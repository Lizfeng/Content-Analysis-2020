Just one question came from the videos!<br />I've found this test the harder one since now! It really got me doubting in several questions!<br /> 
Hey are you guys taking about the quiz or the peer test? cause I have not been able to open the quiz.<br /> 
"This is my first time to do one of these courses. I have now completed everything. What happens next	 where is the final result posted	 will I get an email or will i find it somewhere once the peer assessments are complete?<br /> "
:)) I just got the answer reviewing the materials:)))&nbsp; 
I donÂ´t think that it is a good idea to post questions from the quiz as long as there are still people who have to answer it. The correct answer is NOT theory. The explanation is wrong and should be changed. But it wouldnÂ´t change your results anyway. 
good luck am also from Africa Zambia but live in the states 
Since when the first assessment was assigned 23 points? It was 20 points and&nbsp;I remember having counted it when I was evaluating the other assignments made by my peers. Why did it change now? 
"Hi there: <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm studying the OLI textbook and the Week One overview says to read Units One to Four	 but isn't that for Week Two?

"<p>I was given a 14. I wonder if it's because there's a lot of sex stuff in my assigment	 or it's really that bad?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>POSSIBLE LINK BETWEEN&nbsp;SEXUAL DRIVE&nbsp;AND IQ.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>HYPOTHESiS:</p><p>Sometimes	 when I observe the world	 I notice several&nbsp;&nbsp;stereotypes. One in particular says that people who show and above average interest in sex tend to have a lower IQ than the average population.</p><p>They tend to cheat more&nbsp;on their partners	 divorce more 	 and have more behavior problems. This group as well shows more&nbsp;cases of teenage pregnancy	 school failure and Sexual Transmitted Diseases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But is all this true	 or is just an stereotype? Is it possible to have a healthy and intense sexual life	 and at the same time a high iq? That's what I would like to find out with my experiement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>TARGET SUBJECTS</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We would start with a series of interviews to people aged between 21 to 55 years	 since they represent&nbsp;most part of the adult population. People younger than 21 could not&nbsp; yet be mature enough to know exactly how their sexuality works. Some people older than 55 could have lost interest in sex (menopause in women	 andropause in men)	 since it's already proven that hormonal changes play a huge role on sexual drive. They would come from all walks of life	 students	 housewives	 blue collar workers	 prison inmates	 Wall Street brokers	 artists	 athletes	 etc.</p><p>The questions they would have to answer	 in a totally anoymous way would be:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1- At what age did you lose your virginity? (in case you have lost it	 of course)</p><p>2- How many partners have you had?</p><p>3- How many partners would you like to have?</p><p>4- How easy for you is to reach an orgasm?</p><p>5- Rate from zero to ten your openness to try new positions	 roleplays	 and fantasies.</p><p>6- How many thoughts of a sexual nature do you have during an average day?</p><p>7- Is your libido constant	 or irregular?</p><p>8- How many times do you masturbate on an average day?</p><p>9- How often do you watch adult movies?</p><p>10- Rate from zero to ten your commintment to monogamy?</p><p>11- Is it possible love with no sex?</p><p>12 -is it possible sex with no love?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>METHOD</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once we had the results	 we could tell two different groups apart: people with low sexual drives	 group A 	 and people with high sexial drives	 group B. We&nbsp;have our &nbsp;our independent variable: level of sexual drive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now	 we could start the experiment proper. We would rely on Magnetic Ressonance Imaging Scanner (MRI) to find how they brains works. Each subject would have to complete an IQ test while inside the MRI machine. It would be a classic IQ test	 where 100 points is the average. The MRI would record their brain bloodflow while performing the task	 recording which areas of the brain are more active (shown in the screen in red) 	 and thus demanding more oxygen.</p><p>And we are close to get our dependent variable: IQ.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>RESULTS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once each of the subjects has completed the test	 is time&nbsp;to get some results. Is there a correlation between IQ and sexual drive? If so	 members of one group should have a higher IQ than the average of the other group.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But we could find	 though	 no correlation	 so the avarage IQ of group A would be similar to group B.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>RESULTS ANALYSIS</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1- If we find there is a correlation between A (lower sex drive) and higher IQ	 we could prove the stereotype that says that brainy people tend to show no interest in sex.</p><p>2- If we find there is a correlation between B (high sex drive) and higher IQ we could prove how wrong ""social wisdom"" is.</p><p>3- If we find no correlation	 we can prove that IQ is much more complex than it looks at first sight	 and it would depend on many different factors other than sexual drive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever we find	 I think it will be a interesing finding and will help to clarify myth and reality about sex and IQ.</p> "

"Please Dr Alex	 can you reconsider the distinction grade for 85? I have already achieved 10 courses of Coursera	 and all of them gave distinction for a grade of 85 and above. The course was tenuous	 especially with the OLI which was time-consuming. Even though I get 35 in my final grade I will only manage to have 89.3 as a final grade. This is very frustrating because my lower grades are due to the peer assessment's who were very subjective	 especially in the first one whereby I &nbsp;managed to include all the requirements	 but I did not get full grade. So once again	 please can you reconsider a grade of 85? "
"Hey guys!!! Russians are really everywhere :) Hope	 we will not be lazy and go till the end :) Keep in touch! ;) "
Hi<br />I am not able to use the oli textbook as much as I would like to practice topics so I wonder how long it will be open after the course has ended because then I have more time.

"You're both right about different kinds of learning; I hadn't thought of that and that's a great point.

"<p><b>Hi there Amy	</b></p><p><strong>For your reference	 i think this had been addressed by Alex	 to wit..</strong></p><p><b>Peer evaluations and course completion</b></p>

<p>I'd like to address a few
concerns I've seen popping up in the forums regarding the peer evaluations for
the first written assignment: </p>

<p><span>Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(3rd paragraph)</span>.</p>

<p><span>Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is
difficult for us to review every submission for plagiarism. If a student
plagiarizes for the written assignment	 that is his or her loss. If you suspect
a student has plagiarized his or her assignment	 still evaluate it using the
rubric provided. At the very least	 if a student who has plagiarized receives a
good grade	 it means that he or she at least understands the elements necessary
for a valid experiment.</p>

<p><span>I would also like to
address the comments I've seen in the forums regarding people who	 for personal
reasons	 have fallen behind in the course or are unable to complete it.
Unfortunately	 we are unable to tailor the course to each individual student's
needs. If you find yourself in one of these positions	 we apologize	 but the
course will continue as scheduled. After the course ends	 keep an eye on the
Coursera site in case we decide to run it again.<br />

As usual	 thanks for your enthusiasm towards the course so far	 for continuing

have questions in the forums. Keep it up!<br />

"Hi Shamila... <br />You'll still be able to access the videos and lecture materials.<br />Just need to catch up with going through the materials for the first few weeks.<br />Quizzes are available after every week of videos / lectures.

"What I do is to open a new window	 but I do not know if the results you get in your exercises are going to be integrated in your coursera platform.. "

Can somebody look and the records page lay out and see whether it makes sense? 
"In the first video we're told the DSM Axes are no longer being used. The disorders in the OLI Textbook is being presented in terms of which Axis each is part of. Should we ignore this categorization of the disorders altogether? Dr. Smith mentions it won't be on the quizzes	 but are we to dismiss thinking of the disorders according to this structure? "
"Hello	
I am Ankur Kushwaha from India. Professionally I am software engineer. I am pursuing this course as learning and career perspective. I enrolled this course to widen my conceptual knowledge in psychology. "
Thanks for reminding me about Modules 3 and 4.&nbsp; The answer lies right there.&nbsp; Will definitely read over to do the assignment.<br /> 
"I already wrote in the other thread concerning this question. The right answer to question number 9 is NOT theory. The explanation is wrong	 but is correct that it is marked as wrong. It wonÂ´t change the result but it would be good to give  the right explanation. "

Yes! Please yes! I have to grade an assignment which has picked the same experiment that we learnt in the course. It fulfills all the other criteria and should score an A+ but the person has not designed the experiment him/herself. I need to mention that in the comments.&nbsp; 
Not sure. I am hoping 18 is a decent score. Does anyone know the total of all the criteria put together ? That way we can calculate our percentage.

"<p>Yes	 I do agree that the way this assignment is presented and assessed should be improved. The evaluation rubric criteria does not correspond to the task formulation. I have a feeling that I've been tricked! :)  </p>
<p>1) I focused on proving the validity of my ""experiment"" (mostly internal :D) but it is not evaluated at all! But the sentence ""an independent variable that is not confounded"" kind of suggests it.</p>
<p>2) Some of criteria are too strict or formalized comparing to the text presenting the task. Either they should be softer or the requirements be more explicit.</p>
<p>3) I feel disappointment that the best ""experiment"" of my gradees received the least grade. It is clear	 interesting and has a social significance. The variables are operationalized very well (better than in the other two works) but not called so explicitly.</p>
<p>I hope the task presentation and/or the rubric will be changed in next sessions of the course. The assignment itself is challenging and reading others' works is very enjoyable!</p> "

"<p>I just finished grading five of our peers	 and unfortunately two out of five didn&#39;t appear to have a single original thought of their own. Before anyone starts defending the indefensible	 I found the sources they pulled their material from by paragraph	 and needless to say there was no quoting	 nor attributions of any kind. As if that weren&#39;t enough	 another one submitted a very lengthy paper that didn&#39;t have anything to do with nature vs. nurture and was dedicated to professing the student&#39;s religious beliefs in barely legible English instead.

"Amy	<br />You&nbsp; have written an interesting paper on training dogs	 but it is not an experiment in which you have two groups	 predict an outcome	 measure behaviors	 and then analyze the results.

It is not possible to give a fair mark to your peer if you are left with the choice of '<b>all or nothing</b>'.&nbsp;<br /><br />There should be flexibility in marking. One student may fit the answer to the requirements of the rubric perfectly	 the other may have done it well but something is missing. You can't give the same mark to both	 but also	 you can't give full marks to one and zero to the other.<br /><br /><b>Dear staff	</b> you realize that students have to meet a very big challenge. They need to be both just and fair. It is very difficult	 or should I say	 impossible to give a fair mark with these rubrics.<b> I request you to add flexibility to the rubrics </b>- it can be done even now. Student who had finished evaluation can perhaps do re-evaluation - though	 it will mean more time wasted.<br /><br />By the way	 I think your decision of not making the rubric available before the submission	 was incorrect.

Elvis - that was a good essay. &nbsp;16/23 means you may have passed by the skin of your teeth if they round up to 70%. &nbsp;I'd be pretty upset if I were you too. &nbsp;They need to standardize the peer reviews vs random well and poor essasys and eliminate the people who cant identify them. &nbsp;

"Yeah	 Hey guys! I did not recieve a very high grade on the peer assessment as well. The peer assessments I graded were very different than the one I submitted. They appeared to be structured as to some type of format that almost appeared copied directly out of a book or someone coached them or that they had alot of prior exposure to formatting an experiment design. Which I have a generalized education diploma and no college exposure at all. So when I graded these papers	 I was like Oh No	 these look so much better than mine I am in trouble. Also	 the papers that I graded word length was very long I am guessing very close to 1500 words like it was copied to the word. But when I reviewed the assignment instructions	 It said to keep it simple	 and don't worry about the subject	 etc. So anyway	 I did the best I could	 and I thought even though mine was short and generic	 I felt like I did what the assignment asked for.

The 16th is what I understood to be the case. &nbsp; 
"<p>I can&#39;t write it here before the deadline becausr it&#39;s against the Coursera rules. 
But I can say that it was not the answer mentioned at this trend. </p>

"Hey I am NAME2954947 and currently I am an Au Pair living in the USA. I am 19 years old and originally come from Germany. In October I will be back in Germany to study psychology. I consider this course will help me to understand things better and improve my knowledge already before studying. I am really excited about that. I am just sad	 that this week the kids have spring break	 so I do not have time to watch the lectures that much. I have to take care of them the whole day. It will get better as soon as school starts again :D I don't know much about Psychology scientifically	 but I am sure I will get to know many things here. I am happy I found this course! That makes me feel I do something educational while I am here just sitting the kids	 what makes me feel good at the same time. "
"I want to express my gratitude to prof. Smith and to the TA. I want also to give some feedback maybe useful for future editions of this class. <br />This course has a great base philosophy: ""Psychology as science"". This approach may seem obvious but it is not so common	 at least here in Italy. <br />I think that something more could be done on the side of the videolectures. Those were often just a summary of the information of the OLI textbook. My opinion is that this time could have been used for more challenging topics or for more stimulating questions. In the videolectures I would find also some hint on the approach favored by the prof. Smith. Something that makes the exposition of the different theories less ""flat"".<br />The textbook was very clear but was not updated to the DSM V. In addition it was not downloadable!<br />Thank you to everybody for your time and effort! "
I hope Mr. Smith and the team will run another psychology course. I love how the course is going and how the course materials and the textbook is organised.&nbsp; 
"I will give my two cents here. &nbsp;Javier - you probably got the 4 10s you are bragging about because you used an ""open book"" concept for your quiz because anyone reading your posts would know that a 10 is beyond you. &nbsp;And Nancy get off your high horse! &nbsp;By the looks of it you too will definitely benefit from this course - psychos! &nbsp;On a happier note	 I hope everyone will get the guidance they need assignment 2...&nbsp; "
"The only things I would improve are:<br />The target should be called research hypothesis	 the minimum valid number for a psychology experiment is 51	 and there are no ethics being considered.&nbsp;<br />I would give you a good grade :) "
"That's just it Manoj. We didn't know the rules before hand. In fact	 we were told that this class was not offering a distinction. As you said	 some of us might had made it to 90 with a little more incentive. Maybe some had another class that did offer distinction and that's where they put their extra effort. Yes it was gracious to decide to offer distiction	 but it would have served us much better to have it offered at the beginning of the class rather than after it was all over. "
i am really upset about my grades. i had tried really hard for it and its really frustrating. i got really few marks in my written assignments and its really low than i deserve. i have received 80% marks in final exams and 75% in 10 exams. i am not happy for not even receiving 70% marks. please consider one more time. 
"Electroconvulsive therapy involves the delivery of a series of electric shocks through the scalp to the brain. As many as 100	000 patients receive ECT each year in the U.S.	 mostly for severe Alzhiemer's Disease or other disorders that do not respond to medications. "
"I do not know where to find the information about Watson	 Pavlov	 James	 etc that was on the quiz "
"Thanks everyone	 I could use some study pointers. I think if I keep going over the material more and not worry about the time limit so much it would help me. Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks Again! "
I agree with this post and was going to post something very similar. &nbsp;Alex can you confirm the answer to question 9 is definitely correct please ? &nbsp;thanks

"By mistake I ve written as Georgia State	 is there a way to change it?<br /><br /> "
"I think we don`t have the knowledge to design a complete psychology experiment. Very difficult to do	 with what we have learned till today. "
"What I can add to this thread is that I included two groups in my experiment	&nbsp;a control group and a test group. Since several of the examples in the lessons about designing an experiment had indicated the size of the groups being tested	 I included the number of people in my experiment as well. I was trying to incorporate everything that I had learned into my experiment. Guess I got lucky.<br /><br />You may lose a point or two for not including the actual&nbsp;number or participants	 but if you followed the model and included all of the&nbsp;steps	&nbsp;you shoud still do very well. "
"I believe my grade has been misscalculated. My grade appears as 69.7 and I did the calculations and it appears I have a 71.ZIPCODE3	 therefore	 i deserve a statement of accomplishment. Here are the numbers:<br /><br /><b>Quizzes<br /></b><b></b>10+9+7+7+8+10+7+10+10+0=78<br />78/100x30= 23.4<br /><br /><b>Assignment 1<br /></b>20.5/23x20= 17.826087<br /><br /><b>Assignment 2<br /></b>12/5x20= 16<br /><br /><b>Final Exam<br /></b><b></b>17/35x30= 14.PHONENUM<br /><br />The addition of all the grades is 71.ZIPCODE3	 which rounded is 71.8	 greater than 70%.<br /><br />Thank you!

"Pozdrav svima!<br /><br />Vjerujem da ste dobili nove obavijesti o certifikatu i varanju na testu...nekako mi zvuce arogantno ...zanima me vase misljenje o svemu. Mislim da zasluzujemo certifikat jer se puno uci	 a varanje mi nije palo na pamet	 jer sam se slomila od ucenja...a tada bi sigurno dobila 10 od 10 bodova ???<br /><br /> "

"Hi	<br /><br />Does &nbsp;anybody knows what are in OLI&nbsp;the ""Module 51: <span>Psychology Pre-Test"" and ""Module 52: <span>Psychology Post-Test"" and why they are graded?

I think it's good point - there are too many differences between groups so high possibility of confounding variables;<br />on the other hand - smiling faces were important (good emotions - becuse telemarketers working with people and emotions of other people have impact on stress) - so I think control group should get faces as well - but without smiling ones 
Absolutely agree!!! 
"I did not state clearly that ""the data will be analyzed"" because I think it's very obvious that we will analyze the data after collecting it. So I think I lost the last 3 points :-( "
Hello...all... I am NAME2939330 from India. This subject always had a mystery behind...so thought to learn a bit about it. Looking forward for the course and meet people...with common interest. 
"Two out of six assignments I read were complete copies from the first to the last words.<br />This is really crazy	 what's going on in their heads? Do they think that we don't notice this?

"In the&nbsp;Lecture Video 2.1: Biopsychology an experiment in New Zealand is mentioned.

"Yes	 I understand maths! &nbsp;This isn't a maths question	 it's a literacy question. &nbsp;Nowhere does it state that the first 10 questions are to be accounted for separately.<br />The actual announcement was:<br /><h3>Final exam and Week 11 videos</h3><div>The final exam	 which will open at&nbsp;<b>8:00 am EDT on June 10</b>&nbsp;and will be due at&nbsp;<b>5:00 pm EDT on Sunday	 June 23</b>	 will consist of 30 questions. Since there is no quiz for Week 12	 the first 10 of these questions will cover Week 12.<br /><br />Additionally	 the Week 11 videos should be up and running as usual	 as of a couple hours ago. Subtitles should be available later this week.<br /><br />- Alex</div><div>Mon 3 Jun 2013 6:55 PM BST (UTC +0100)<br /><br />which merely states that there will be more questions on week 12 material in the final exam as there was <b>no quiz for week 12</b>. &nbsp;Those questions will probably have been easy for most students as the material would have been fresh in their minds. &nbsp;I don't think that just because it would help you to get a distinction (which you say you don't care about anyway...) that you should potentially harm someone else's chance of getting one. &nbsp;The rules should stay as they were always stated to be. &nbsp;That is fair. &nbsp;(In case you're wondering	 it wouldn't affect my result either way)</div> "

"I was surprised to see that we had to mention number of subjects. In the experiment I've designed	 it's impossible to know beforehand how many participants would be in the study. In fact	 that number is part of my operational definition	 something that I measure.<br /> "
There is no text file for Video Lecture 1.4. Being a visual learner this is important to me. I can see that all the other lectures have text files so I'm assuming it's just an oversight. Look forward to the fix. Thank you!<br /> 
"Same problem here. I can understand the main idea of the lecture but since my English listening skill is not good at all	 I still need the subtitle	 so please upload it. "

"Eleni	 indeed the worst grade in the quizes is subtracted from the sum (in the excel file	 if you see the calculation in the average of the quizes' grades the minimum grade is  subtracted-but this occurs only for the quizes).<br />Indeed it is a very useful tool.

"I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the logic in the example with the telemarketers. How can this be a ""true"" experiment when the factor of the moods of the customers hasn't been taken into consideration. I used to do telemarketing and trust me	 there's a difference in customers. When I called people for the Christian Bookclub people were so nice and sweet and sales went up. Calling people for Doubleday Bookclub got lots of swearing and hang ups and minimal sales. Also what day of the week you call	 and what time of day makes a big difference as well. There are many factors. <br /><br />I think this example should be considered quasi-experimental because of confounding variables!! Am I correct?<br /> "

I think the issue  is around the defintion of 'instinct'. Instictive or innate behaviour is a behaviour that is not learnt and is thus mostly genetically determined; whereas chaos is caused by *irrational* behaviour :)

"Hello everyone	<br /><br />I will just jump right into things. I have done a number of classes through coursera with peer grading. In every class	 the peer graded assignments were adjusted by weight in the overall grade. &nbsp;Specifically because of the following. &nbsp;First	 an issue with the rubric. &nbsp;As in the case for this assignment	 it appears that the rubric or specifications were not included in the initial assignment. &nbsp;Second	 for a large number of students	 English is not their first language	 and there can be issues with programs used	 interpretations	 and translations. &nbsp;Another issue can be format. &nbsp;This assignment being an experiment	 one should take into consideration that some people may have written a paper	 some an outline	 and some a proposal. &nbsp;Others may have actually done an experiment. &nbsp;It is important to keep in mind	 that regardless of how experienced the professors	 programmers	 or community TA's are	 this is more than likely their first attempt at a peer graded venture	 specifically through coursera.<br /><br />All things considered	 I simply suggest that one peer grades on a bit of curve. &nbsp;Do not simply compare the paper you are reviewing to your own	 and while it goes against this part of the grading for the course	 not solely on the rubric itself. &nbsp;Certain criteria regarding this assignment and how it would be graded was not readily available. &nbsp;To that end	 I can only urge those of you that are frustrated	 concerned	 worried	 and/or confused on how to grade	 be patient. &nbsp;Do the best you can grading as you did with your assignment. &nbsp;One thing that I am certain of is that when we receive grades from the rubric used and the peer grading	 that the forum will be crazy	 and students will be even more confused and concerned than the large number that have expressed their concerns already.<br /><br />Thanks	 good luck	 and regardless of issues	 differences	 and frustrations	 enjoy the process of learning. &nbsp;<br /><br />JD "

I am intrigued by the fact that there are far fewer comments on this thread than there were for the equivalent thread for the first assignment. Are there far fewer of us left - or have most people just given up on commenting? <br /> 
"Sure	 there are whiners. But most people are honest folks with reak grievances. Most of those who complain are those who feel they have something to lose compared to others and in the whole grading scheme. They only seek what's fair. Extensions may seem unfair to those who rushed to meet the deadline. Others who were truly inconvenienced by say internet connectivity would be happy. Then there are those who submit early	 in their wisdom	 to avoid having last-minute problems. We all respond according to how a decision will affect us. We have that 'right'. Those who have great scores could care less. Surely	 we have learnt so much. And for free too. Does this mean we shouldn't complain????<br /> "

"Thank you for your response. But	 I am not sure that if we take (the first) 10 questions from the final exam and treat them as a quiz more people will suffer.<br />Suppose: quizes are done after the week	 so everything is fresh in his/her memory. This applies also to the first 10 questions regarding week 12 in the final exam. Okay	 you can say	 but the students have also to learn the material of the 11 previous weeks. That means they have to learn more stuff and be able to memorize it for the final since you have to take the final exam in one time without retests. So we can assume that doing the weekly quizes are relatively easy (fresh in mind and mutipul attemps). The final exam	 including week 12 has no second attemps. That is more difficult	 so you could say it is fair to give the right answer a heavier weight in the final grade. So far	 so good. But	 as you mentioned	 the lowest (I suppose this means also that one quiz score will not be regarded if you have equal 2-10 quiz scores) quiz score will be dropped.<br />So	 if we assume that - due to the cumulative content in the final exam and the students dispersion of his time over all the material from week 1 - 12 - a student scores 0 on the first 10 questions in the final exam and if we further assume	 as I propose	 to seperate these first 10 questions from the final exam score and count them as an ordinary quiz score than this 0 score will be dropped. That is an adNAME3125398tage for the students. His 0 score will not be counted for in his/her final grade.<br />If we assume that the student scores 10 point for the first 10 questions than it would be better for him/her if this score does count in the final exam score.<br />So the question is: what are the chance that a student scores higher on the first 10 final exam questions (regarding week 12) than average on the quizes score over week 1-11? I really don't know. <br />In my opinion the chance is that he/she scores lower than average score of the quizes (week 1-11)	 since (a) he/she has to study and memorize all the material (from week 1-12) and not only for 1 week (as is the case for the quizes)	 and b. there are no second or third attemp possibilities in the final exam (even not for first 10 questions).<br />So	 I think it is plausible to expect a relatively low score on the first 10 questions of the final exam and the consequence is that this relatively low score will amount for a big deal in the final exam score and also in the final grade.<br /><br />If	 however	 a student realizes that the first 10 questions regarding week 12 are so heavily weighted in the final exam he/she can choose the strategy to give relatively more attention to the week 12 material than to the material of week 1-11 and acquire thus a head start in the final exam score and his/her final grade.<br /><br />BTW: it is just my opinion. It is up to the staff to make eventually a decision in this discussion. Have a nice day.<br /><br /> "

"I just read through several other threads and saw people post their specific scores from more than one peer... So they can SEE scores from more than one	 while I only seem to have one to see. IF that's what happened - it can't be averaged.<br /><br />Classmates: Please add your votes to let this be seen.<br /><br />Staff--- PLEASE What happened? Is there a way to get it at least COMMENTED on to know WHY they graded it as they did? Or get more peers to grade it? "

I too had the same problem .But I presume this test marks are not counted towards the final grading.

"Having completed the evaluation phase for Assignment 1	 and having therefore realized how poorly the assignment instructions described the expectations revealed in the marking rubric	 I am even more strongly of the opinion that allocating 40% of the overall course grade to peer assessments is a fundamentally flawed concept. Perhaps	 just maybe	 peer assessments could work with very clear instructions	 guidelines on the process of evaluation and a good marking rubric. However	 this assignment had none of these. In earlier posts I expressed my concerns about peer assessments and Assignment 1 has definitely confirmed those concerns.<br /> "

My guess is that questions skipped (not filled) by the evaluators get 0 (or maybe even less). This explains why last questions get 0 with higher probability.

"My opinion...on your first point	 survival	 a newborn has no survival instinct. It will just sit there and eventually die if no one comes to it's aid. Most of our development is outside the womb of the mother whereas in other organisms this occurs within the womb. So our survival depends on what we are taught (and a lot of luck). Your second	 just reflexes	 nothing more. A kid will stick his hand in a flame the first time	 always (unless taught not to	 of course	  and then he'll probably try it anyway) then he gets burned and learns not to do it again. I'll skip the third point but the fourth and fifth	 in my opinion	 takes advantage of human weaknesses and has nothing to do with instinct. But then what do I know...I'm taking an introductory course in psychology. "

"The problem with grading on a curve is that if a large percentage of the class is doing well	 some will be graded down into the non-passing grade even if they performed as expected.&nbsp; Curve-grading	 in my opinion	 does more to grade the abilities of the instructor than the abilities of the students.<br /><br />I do not have time to complete a third assignment.&nbsp; If the second assignment produces mostly bad grading by peers	 a third assignment will only strengthen the faults.

Identify a problem and write an observation (rationale for choosing the problem)</p><p>Nowadays	 many&nbsp;people die as a result of&nbsp;car accidents. In many of these cases	 it's reported that the consumption of&nbsp;alcohol by the driver	&nbsp;prior to driving	 is one of the determinants of these unfortunate car accidents.</p><pre>In&nbsp;an abstract from the article ""human factors in the causation of road traffic crashes""&nbsp;written in the&nbsp;European Journal of Epidemiology 2000. Volume 16	 Issue 9	 pp 819-826	 it's mentioned that "" <i>Road traffic crashes (RTCs) are responsible for a substantial fraction of morbidity and mortality and are responsible for more years of life lost than most of human diseases. In this review	 we have tried to delineate behavioral factors that collectively represent the principal cause of three out of five RTCs and contribute to the causation of most of the remaining. Although sharp distinctions are not always possible	 a classification of behavioral factors is both necessary and feasible. Thus	 behavioral factors can be distinguished as (i) those that reduce capability on a long-term basis (inexperience	 aging	 disease and disability	 alcoholism	 drug abuse)	 (ii) those that reduce capability on a short-term basis (drowsiness	 fatigue	 acute alcohol intoxication	 short term drug effects	 binge eating	 acute psychological stress	 temporary distraction)	 (iii) those that promote risk taking behavior with long-term impact (overestimation of capabilities	 macho attitude	 habitual speeding	 habitual disregard of traffic regulations	 indecent driving behavior	 non-use of seat belt or helmet	 inappropriate sitting while driving	 accident proneness) and (iv) those that promote risk taking behavior with short-term impact (moderate ethanol intake	 psychotropic drugs	 motor vehicle crime	 suicidal behavior	 compulsive acts)</i>.""</pre><p>We can notice in this abstract that consumption of alcohol by drivers is a major&nbsp;factor associated with traffic crashes.&nbsp;Therefore	 taking into account the behavior of the drivers that drunk alcohol prior to driving	 we can wonder what are the determinants that make these drivers use&nbsp;their cars to&nbsp;move to another location	 although some of them&nbsp;just drunk a substantive amount of alcohol and should not be driving	 putting at risk their lives and&nbsp;the lives of other people while on the roads?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.

"Further when we check papers we should try to forget ourselves	 our own scores and fear of the future scores.<br />In the first assignment I did not explicitly state the independent and dependent variables not because I do not know what they mean.<br />Because I thought it was &nbsp;not necessary.&nbsp; <br />But I'm always thinking that the papers that I've checked are papers of innocent people who deserve a decent treatment.&nbsp; What happened was not their fault. There was a total miscommunication as to instruction and the way some students understand what's being asked. And this is the disadvantage of online learning and handling thousands&nbsp; students. Clarifications is too hard if not impossible. But at the end of the day	 it's what you've learned. <br />And mind you	 grades will not be reflected in the certificate. So its not about who will be getting the high or the low grades. <br />Its about helping each other get a passing mark by being reasonable. "

"No	 I'm not very happy with my 7/15. While it doesn't matter to me	 I'm providing&nbsp;this feedback for those designing these courses to consider. <br /><br />In other Coursera courses I've taken	 I've been surprised at the quality of my peer-given grades. <br /><br />However	 this assignment is an exception.&nbsp;If I were paying for this course	 I'd be rather sad if the 7/15 I got from the&nbsp;only peer evaluation I received prevented me from getting a certificate of accomplishment 	 even though I diligently read all the materials and took all the quizzes/tests. <br /><br />20% for&nbsp; one peer-graded assignment seems&nbsp;a bit too much weight	 as&nbsp;it could actually&nbsp;be putting&nbsp;the determination of one's success in the course in the hands of a single peer reviewer. <br /><br />Other Coursera courses I've taken have included a practice-grading module for peer reviewers to complete before they actually grade&nbsp;assignments&nbsp;(I'm not sure this helps	 actually	 but it seems to be a&nbsp;step in the right direction.)<br /><br />Actually	 the reviewer that gave my&nbsp;essay&nbsp;a 7/15 wrote as a comment that it was well-written and well-researched. However	 by strictly following the rubric	 this same reviewer&nbsp;gave me a failing grade because I used synonyms (that actually made my paper clearer and more understandable) rather than the specific words mentioned in the rubric (e.g.	 heritability).<br /><br />Also	 I've always heard that rubrics should be given out WITH the assignment	 not kept secret. If I had seen the rubric in advance	 I could easily have used the exact words mentioned in it.<br /><br />But I've really enjoyed this course. This is just feedback to consider if the course is offered again. "

"Had that same problem too	 and even though I had read this passage: ""<i>&nbsp;</i> <br /><p><i>Now that you are more familiar with the distinction between informational
					conformity and normative conformity	 we can apply these concepts to the studies

				</i><p><i>The behavior of Sherifâ€™s participants is thought to be the result of
					informational conformity	 or the use of other peopleâ€”their comments and
					actionsâ€”as a source of information about what is likely to be correct. The task
					Sherif asked his participants to perform was ambiguous	 since the light doesnâ€™t
					move at all	 but just appears to. And that appearance	 being so uncertain and
					ambiguous	 is readily influenced by the expressed judgments of others.</i></p><i>
				</i><p><i>Informational conformity is not thought to be the main source of conformity
					pressure in Aschâ€™s study	 however. For the most part	 the right answer was clear
					to participants	 as evidenced by the fact that individuals in a control group
					who made these judgments by themselves	 without any social pressure	 almost
					never made a mistake. Although some informational conformity likely was present	
					the primary reason people conformed was to avoid standing out	 negatively	 among
					the group members. That is	 the behavior of Aschâ€™s participants is thought to be
					the result of normative conformity due to the desire to avoid the disapproval
					and harsh judgments of others.</i></p><i>
				</i><p><i>Informational conformity	 by influencing how we come to see the issues or stimuli
					before us	 tends to influence our private acceptance of the position advanced by
					the majority. Tending to assume that others have things right	 we adopt the
					groupâ€™s perspective. Normative conformity	 in contrast	 often has a greater
					influence on public compliance than on private acceptance. To avoid disapproval

an excellent idea to refer back to the methods from the previous section and

"I am reproducing below an extract from the Pedagogy page of Coursera. It is under the paragraph ""Peer Assessments"".<br /><br /><a title=""Link: https://www.coursera.org/about/pedagogy"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.coursera.org/about/pedagogy"">https://www.coursera.org/about/pedagogy</a> <br /><br />QUOTE:<br />Given our commitment to offer courses from a broad range of disciplines	
 we have invested substantial effort in developing the technology of 
peer assessments	 where students can evaluate and provide feedback on 
each otherâ€™s work. This technology draws on two bodies of literature: 
First	 the education literature on peer assessments.  Following the 
literature on <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1662/0002-7685%ZIPCODE1%29063%5NAME4878970474:CPR%5D2.0.CO%3NAME4878972"">student peer reviews</a>	
 we have developed a process in which <i><b>students are first trained using a
 grading rubric</b></i> to grade other assessments.  This has been shown to 
result in accurate feedback to other students	 and also provide a 
valuable learning experience for the students doing the grading.  
Second	 we draw on ideas from the literature on <a title=""Link: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1613751"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1613751"">crowd-sourcing</a>	
 which studies how one can take many ratings (of varying degrees of 
reliability) and combine them to obtain a highly accurate score.  Using 
such algorithms	 we expect that by having multiple students grade each 
homework	 we will be able to obtain grading accuracy comparable or even 
superior to that provided by a single teaching assistant. <br />:UNQUOTE<br /><br />It appears that the apprehensions of some of us are misplaced&nbsp; :))<br /> "
"EMAIL27764 thanks for your reply I understand and accept that different evaluators can have different assessments of the same paper. However in the lower yellow box there is no mention of evaluator 1	 there is a mention of evaluator 2 who did not leave any comment and a mention to evaluator 3 who left a comment. That made me think that one evaluator is missing from the picture.... "
"Rules have changed midway. Perhaps	 the ratio of performances above 70% to qualify for a Certificate has not reached the desired level (!).<br />Now every one is positively reinforced to score the maximum in the balance 8 quizzes ... :D<br /> "
"In another thread a link for getting a downloadversion of the OLI was posted:<br /><a target="""" href=""http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/course/book/ZIPCODE"">http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/course/book/ZIPCODE</a><br />So I think the OLI Textbook is based on (or identical with?) this book by Charles Stangor.<br /><br />In other coursera courses you don't have a textbook at all	 so normally you just have the videos	 the quizzes	 maybe some assignments. So	 even if the textbook was not written by himself it's nevertheless Prof. Smith's course.<br />And as this book normally is not for free I appreciate adding it to this course whoever is the author of this book :-)<br /> "
"Cultural differences	 maybe? Maybe people aren't ashamed to ask for help if they experience some of the psychological problems? Others have mentioned other possible influences: stress	 'pills for everything' etc. Just my two cents.<br /> "

"I agree.

"Hi Everyone	 I'm Nicci from New Zealand.  I have BSc in Geology and eventually (when I can fit it in around raising my two children) I am interested in continuing with postgraduate study	 probably in the field of hazard communication.  I've always been interested in psychology	 and would like to combine a more person-focused approach with my geological background.  Having lived through the devastating Christchurch earthquakes of 2010 and 2011 I now have a much deeper appreciation for the importance of excellent hazard communication	 and this course seems like a great next step to diversify my education. "
I appreciate your taking the time to clarify&nbsp;Assignment 2. It helped me to know what to include and how to target my writing. 
"The Bell curve is a Gauss curve. It is a probability density function. To calculate the surface under the curve you have to integrate the curve over the given area	 e.g. + and - x SD is roughly 68% of the surface. The curve can be broader or smaller or skwewed. <br /> "
"Okay really? This is what really gets me -- Alex said that it would not be fair to give us the rubric beforehand. Yeah right! HOW in the world were we supposed to know that it was all or nothing points-wise if we mentioned twin and family comparisons?? This is a case in which a rubric would have&nbsp;<i>guided</i> us to writing the best essay we could.&nbsp;<br /><br />Also	 is it not true that Alex said what matters is&nbsp;<b>our defense of which way (nature or nurture) has the most effect on our construct</b>? I said that nurture has the greatest effect on my construct and therefore spent most of my essay defending that point. Then I come to find that the entire rubric focuses on heritability (genetics	 or the&nbsp;<b></b><i>nature</i> point of view)!&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm very frustrated that what Alex said to focus on is not accounted for whatsoever in the grading of the assignment and I hope he sees this and can understand why.&nbsp; "
"Actually	 I think that is probably an error on the Week 12 page. &nbsp;The peer assessment grades are almost certain to be available 1 hour after evaluation has closed. &nbsp;The dates and times on the actual peer assessment page will be those which apply. &nbsp;So	 evaluations must be submitted by 16th June.

"Jennifer	<br /><br />It all boils down to the basic question of whether the downtrodden is ready for hard work. If yes	 positive nurturing will wipe out the effect of inheritance (nature). 'Flynn effect' has already proved that IQ of all developing persons increase by 3 points every 10 years. Therefore	 remaining stupid is a choice inasmuch as developing intelligence by hard work is also a choice.<br /><br />The science of genetics in concurrence with the theory of evolution has shown that inherited genes are subject to mutations either for the better (Intelligence) or for the worse (Cancer) depending on the type of nurture (either exercise or smoking).<br /><br />World over	 upper class protect their turf by keeping the downtrodden away from opportunities. It is a vicious cycle. Wherever it is broken	 gene mutation takes effect and the downtrodden develop and join the main stream	 say in about a couple of generations.<br /><br />I liked your question. It is a very valid one. <br /> "
"I also agree that it would be really helpful for all of us since there was much frustration&nbsp;for this assignment which was posted just after the scores of the peer evaluation of the first assignment have been known to us.<br />We are reaching the end of the seminar	 and the end of an academic year	 which might mean that&nbsp;some of us&nbsp;being tired and have many things to do at the same time.

"Prof. Smith	<br />I still have a problem with the final exams. Why was this announcement not sent to our emails as usual but just written on the announcement page?

I think this should have been sent to us because some of us mostly get updates through our mails. I got to know the dead line was extended but could not do it because it had ended.

"Irrational thinking gave 15 attemps in the quizes	 and only one assigment	 where you had to score at least 6/10. That is total madness. Very easy on the quizes very difficult on the assigments. <br /><br />Here	 on the contrary	 it's much more rational. ome attempt at quizes	 like in real life	 and two assigments	 so you can have two chances if you blow the first one. And the ninimum to get the certificate is 70 per cent	 which sounds more reasonable than 85 in Irrational Thinking.<br /><br /><br />The OIL textbook is a masterpiece	 I've never found anything so detailed and clear	 and you can get inmediate feedback in the exercises. <br /><br />You read the new post on the anouncements section	 the whole point is making you think	 they donÂ´t give the steps becase people is supposed to be smart enough to find them .<br /><br />I doubt the staff of UNIVERSITY are shutting down in the face of difficulty	 maybe they donÂ´t feel the need to fix something where there's nothing to be fixed.<br /> "

"I believe you will have to try to evaluate what is there.&nbsp; The student may have made a mistake in pasting.&nbsp; There is an option to review the assignment after it is submitted	 so&nbsp;you shouldn't&nbsp;feel bad about only grading what is there. "
"Hi&nbsp;<br /><br />I have a question for the course team. I have to evaluate an assignment which has explained one of the same experiments we read about in this course (the one with the children's aggressive behaviour when they saw an adult play with a bobo doll). According to the evaluation criteria	 it gets 5 points on all questions	 but it's not original work. How do I grade an assignment like that?&nbsp;<br /><br />Please advice.&nbsp; "
"I agree with the concerns about peer assessments - particularly when they represent 40% of the total course marks. As an educator (MSc in Education and Training) who taught college for several years	 I am very aware that assessment is a specialized skill that requires both training and practice. Just having some basic guidelines and a marking rubric will not guarantee competent assessments. As others have mentioned	 I also recently took a Coursera course with a peer assessment component and was appalled by the inconsistency of marking - even though detailed guidelines and marking rubrics were provided.<br /><br />Additionally	 there is the question of whether all of us have the time to mark each others' work. The course I mentioned <b>required</b> that each student mark 5 other students' work per peer assessment (you lost course marks if you did not do them). For many of us	 finding time to do the course is challenging enough - devoting enough time to properly assess the work of others is an additional burden.<br /><br />I understand the need for practical assessment solutions for MOOCs - there are simply too many students for faculty to mark everyone's work. That being the case	 assessment via multiple-choice quizzes/final exams would seem to be the only real solution. I have also taken several Coursera courses that have exclusively used this type of assessment.<br /><br />Of course	 writing good multiple-choice assessments is also a very skilled art but	 thus far in my Coursera experience	 bad multiple-choice questions have been highlighted and mitigated. There is no such mitigation process for poor peer assessments. <br /><br />I also agree that anyone who has paid to be on Signature Track should not be subject to the vagaries of unqualified assessors.<br /><br /> "

"In which week are we going to get our assignments	 and when will they be due? "
Srividya thank you very much! 
I can't access the OLI textbook and I need to access it urgently because I haven't completed my Week 1 quiz. 
Thanks very much to all who organised and delivered this course. As a teacher I thought it was very well planned. The videos and weekly exams were an excellent way of ensuring that we knew the material. The interactive text book was the best learning tool I think I have ever seen. Would that all text books could be so presented! An excellent course. I enjoyed every minute and look forward to more. Thank you again 
"<p>Personally	 I liked the book: I liked that there are videos and a lots of test-yourself-questions. Thanks to the book I've got a high grade on the first quiz. 
I liked that Professor Smith has shown us what is EEG and MRI. <br /></p><p>BUT: how many brain imaging techniques does the book cover? Much more. I would love to hear from Professor Smith about CT	 PET	 rTMS	 lesion studies etc. etc. I would prefer 8 lectures in place of 4. I don't like to compare	 because every course is ""stand alone"" and the Professor is in charge	 but I am taking ""know thyself"" and there we do have 8 interesting lectures. </p> "
"Hi Alex	<br /><br />For your information	 my scores also have the same problem.&nbsp;I have not earned a Statement of Accomplishment as it says I have got 63% according to the course records. But when I calculated I have got 89.57%. Well I do not know whether it will be given a&nbsp;Distinction but at least according to the course data I should be getting a&nbsp;<span>Statement of Accomplishment	 since it is &gt; 70%. I think the system have not added the final exams marks. Please be kind enough to look in to this matter. &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Thanks<br />NAME2071140 "
Two upvotes and zero answers? wtf? 
The implication is that you inaccurately reduce your correct word count to the Assignment submission.&nbsp; The deleted content probably contains valuable thoughts that contribute to the value of your work that could effect your grade. 
"Does someone know how the grade is actually calculated?<br />I know the text from the syllabus (30% quizzes	 40% assessments	 30% final exam).<br />But what is 40% from the ""grade that was simply given by your peers?""<br /><br />I just want to know whether I have made the 70% treshold to succesfully have finished the course. "
"Now I suspect that my work was also evaluated by just one person. <br />I have only whole numbers	 and the question that is&nbsp;<span>explicitly</span>&nbsp;correct was graded badly. I posted it on a forum and no one said that the mark is fair. Cannot believe that 3 people scored it the same. "
 
I can`t find my certificate!! Where to llok? 
"May be I missed something	 but the answer to one of the questions cannot be find in the OLI Textbook. I searched the keywords and got ""no results"".&nbsp;<br />I'm not sure I can tell the number of question. "
"Did the student explicitly state the hypothesis	 or you have to conclude on your own? If the research hypothesis is precise	 and is not null	 then you don't have to worry. Can you find such a hypothesis?<br /> "

"<p>What was the maximum grade?</p>
 "
"I always thought that the first assignment was out of 20. Should it be this way	 I pass. But out of 23	 I miss 1.9 to have the 70 score.<br /><br />It would also be very useful if the staff could look at the evaluations made by the peers. For the second evaluation	 3&nbsp;peers said that my&nbsp;assignment was very good. 1 last peer completely destroyed&nbsp;my second assignment	 and saw it&nbsp;very differently than the 3 former ones. I got 11 out of 15 for the second assignment. I now miss 1.9 to pass. Is it possible for the staff just to have a look at my assignments? I would really appreciate. Something else	 why when I look back at the assessment	 I can't see how many points were attributed to each section of the assessment	 for instance 3 out of 5...<br /><br />But overall	 it was a very good course	 with good instructors&nbsp;and I wish a lot of success to future students	 although the way that assessments are made should be reconsidered for future sessions. "
"According to the course	 catharsis increases agressiveness. Does it relieve stress or this technic does not helpful at all? I heard catharsis is pretty common in some cultures and even some of my friends use that to deal with unplesant situations... "
"It is very difficult for me to do a just evaluation. According to the instructions we were given	 I am supposed to give a successful plagiarist a perfect score but any good work that doesn't follow this inflexible rubric gets a zero?!<br /><br />The videos and OLI are so good	 but the assignments have been a disappointment. "
Could you prolongate&nbsp;Psychology Pre-Test? It would be a greate possibility for me to pass it.

            experience a variety <b>of secondary emotions </b>(in this case	 the negative ones)â€”for
            instance	 feeling <b>angry	 sad</b>	 resentful	 and ashamed. You might mull over the event for

People affected by confirmation bias select evidence and information supporting their views	 and tend to ignore and discredit information contrary to their beliefs.&nbsp;This kind of prejudice is found in people suffering from clinical disorders	 where it can make a person life disfunctional	 but it is common throughout all social groups	 including scientists (Mahoney	 1977).&nbsp;</p><p>While carrying out a research on humane methods of wildlife control	 I realized that most biologists outright reject the possibility of humane scientific methods	 such as fertility control. I was really surprised to discover none of the European scientists I talked to knew about the existence of an International Conference on Fertility Control in Wildlife	 while they all know and most participate in Pest Management Conferences. Thereâ€™s only one International Conference on Fertility Control in Wildlife	 but there are all kinds of Pest Management Conferences: European	 EuroAsian	 Interstate within the US	 urban.</p><p>Fertility control is widely employed and well tested method for the control of wildlife	 with&nbsp;PZP contraceptive vaccines currently used to manage the population of 85 wildlife species (Kirkpatrick	 2011).</p><p>Most biologists working with problematic wildlife or alien species carry out eradication programmes for a living	 belong to specialist groups whose predominant view is that alien species are â€œharmfulâ€	 are at least partly aware of the fact their own eradication programmes are oftentimes unsuccessful	 sometimes harnful; moreover	 they have to withstand the pressure of a society which every day becomes more sensitive to the question of animal suffering. These facts would strengthen their beliefs: Nobody wants to be proven wrong	 especially when so much is at stake.</p><p>METHOD</p><p>The idea is to select two separate groups of biologists from different European countries. The independent variable consists in an invitation to a seminar. The dependent variable is their behaviour	 that is	 the way they will act after being approached.</p><p>Once the biologists have been chosen they are randomly divided into Group A and Group B. The two groups are invited to a seminar	 and&nbsp;given a brief explanation of what the talk will be about as well as printed material to read. They are told the speaker is a biologist with many years of experience in wildlife control. Although they will listen to same talk	 Group A is invited to attend a seminar on ""Humane Methods of Control of Wildlife"" organized by an animal's rights group. Group B is asked whether they would be willing to attend a seminar on ""Fertility Control of Pest Species"" held by an important university.&nbsp;</p><p>After the seminar	 both groups are asked to fill in a questionnaire. The key question in Group A's questionnaire it is whether they would be willing to try out a more humane method of eradication during their next project	 a method which has already proven successful on the species they work with. Group B would be asked whether they would consider trying out a tested method of fertility control	 which has already proven successful on the species they work with.&nbsp;The questionnaires aimed at Group A use a wording reminescent of human rights advocacy - humane methods	 animals as sentient beings	 killing	 etc. -	 while the questionnare directed at Group B would employ a more detached	 scientific use of words.</p><p>While the seminar and the information are the same	 and the methods presented are scientifically valid	 my prediction is that Group B would be more open to attend the seminar but not so much to adopt new methods of eradication control	 which might challenge their views. Group A will will probably reject an invitation coming from whom	 to them	 has the wrong perspective on things. Even when attending	 they would not consider alternative methods of control a possibility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>REFERENCES</p><p>Mahoney	 M.	&nbsp;Publication Prejudices: An Experimental Study of Confirmatory Bias in the Peer Review System	&nbsp;Cognitive Therapy and Research	 Vol. 1	 No. 2	 1977	 PP. 161-1 75 [accessed online:&nbsp;<a href=""http://people.stern.nyu.edu/wstarbuc/Writing/Prejud.htm]"" target="""">http://people.stern.nyu.edu/wstarbuc/Writing/Prejud.htm]</a></p><p>Kirkpatrick	 J.

"I guess I have low confidence because I have been corrected by my mother	 teachers and peers since I was young.

Or I could just be a pessimistic person.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our current technology is not making things better	 there's a share and comment option for whatever you post online and recently	 they decided to add a like and dislike function too.

If I have to make a guess i would say that this assignment is open to the dialogue. Maybe the professor and the staff want to see how we can cooperate. Their words are to use the forum. In other words maybe the criteria of evaluation are not so fixed but they want from us to produce them. We must not forget that we are the ones who evaluate the assignments and if we can agree in a set of evaluation criteria then maybe they will be accepted by the teaching staff.<br />Of course this is only my point of view.<br /> 
"I fully agree	 this is ""sick""... "
"Can we use the material from the internet? Of course	 I didn't mean copy-paste. "
"In other Coursera courses I took or am taking	 written assignments criteria are listed before you submit your assignment. This takes away a lot of guessing and allows you to prepare better work. We're here to learn	 and should be guided. And	 in some courses peer evaluations have no score	 or the score is not so important to the overall grade	 because peers are not experts. I am not &nbsp;satisfied with the way written assignments are presented and evaluated in this particular course.&nbsp; "
"I think the rubric is overdependent on the ambiguous phrase: ""can be used to determine heritability"". For fields that end with that	 I am giving points if the writeup	 implicitly or explicitly	 discusses&nbsp;how X is of interest in the nature versus nurture debate in respect to the selected construct.<br /><br />I agree with the recurring sentiment in this thread that following the rubric to the letter will make some really good work get poor marks. Better to be generous when in doubt.<br /> "

"A good question	 Sara. I went into My Scores and found empty in all boxes on first 4 modules (work for Week I). IWOULD LIKE A MEMBER OF STAFF TO ANSWER THIS. Along the left side is Attempts. I completed every single exercise in the interactive OLI modules. What 	if anything else	 should I have done in order to have scores recorded. I also did the quiz for week 1. Upon completion my score 9/10 came up. Today I went back in to the quiz. It says Attempt 1/1. No score given and untimed. I did not know that we had to time the quiz	 nor do I think there was &nbsp;a facility for timing. For the record I did it in about 10 mins. Where is that result recorded?. Also when I tried to access week 2 I got system error. I would also like further clarification about peer assessment. I read one thread suggesting that 40% goes on peer assessment? This can hardly be correct. &nbsp;Thank you "

"Ahmed	<br />I presume from your post that you have effectively attended 5 quizzes.<br />Five weekly quizzes you have completed in time account for 15% of the final grade at 3% per weekly quiz.<br />The deadline for Quiz-6 and Quiz-7 are over and you cannot do much about them. However	 you can afford to miss one quiz out of 11.<br />The balance 4 quizzes (Quiz-8 to Quiz-11) account for 12% and available to you.<br />You have missed the first Peer Assessment and nothing could be done about it.<br />What you have effectively missed is one quiz (3%) and one peer assessment (20%).<br />The second assessment is under way and you can participate in it. It accounts for 20%.<br />Final examination is due and it accounts for 30%.<br /><br />In all	 you have missed your submissions for 23%. Ratings available for you is the balance 77%. The minimum pass score is 70% to earn a certificate of accomplishment. You have a slender chance of making it.<br /> "

"<h2>&nbsp; &nbsp;intelligence -------&nbsp;nature versus nurture</h2><h2>part I</h2><p><i><b>1.the fundamental question&nbsp;</b></i></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; According to the past learning	 we have known about that psychologists have long debated how to best conceptualize and measure intelligence.

Socioeconomic status (i.e.	 income and social opportunities) can affect the type of neighborhood a person can afford to live in	 the quality of schooling and likelihood of preschool educational opportunities	 and likelihood of taking advantage of educational activities (e.g.	 visiting museums and historical sites). Differences in parental education levels can have a huge impact. For instance	 Hart and Risley<span>&nbsp;</span>studied interactions between adults and children in families differing in socioeconomic status and education. This was not a race difference study. They found that children of professional-level parents heard three times as many words and far more complex and unusual words than did children of unemployed parents	 and children of working-class parents heard twice as many words as the children of unemployed parents. Although a word count like this may seem unimportant	 exposure to language is very important for development of communication skills and categories of knowledge.</li></ul><h2>part II</h2><div>In my opinion 	the intelligence is more determine by nature. So	 I can design an experiment to make a provement for that.</div><p><i><b><br /></b></i></p><p><i><b>1.the methods that we collect data to address the issue&nbsp;</b></i></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such as&nbsp;The Wechsler Adult lntelligence Scale (WAIS)	which &nbsp;is the most widely used intelligence test for adults. The current version of the WAIS	 called the WAIS-IV	 was standardized on 2	200 people ranging from 16 to 90 years of age. It consists of 15 different tasks	 each designed to assess intelligence	 including working memory	 arithmetic ability	 spatial ability	 and general knowledge about the world (see the figure below). The WAIS-IV yields scores on four domains: verbal	 perceptual	 working memory	 and processing speed. The&nbsp;reliability&nbsp;of the test is high (more than 0.95)	 meaning that&nbsp;when a person is assessed at different times on the test	 the person will score approximately the same every time with more than a 95% accuracy rate.&nbsp;</p><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i><b>the key of the experiment&nbsp;</b></i></span></p><ul><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; set about 3 groups &nbsp;perticipants(parents with their children )	each group have 1000 family. and pick the families from socity envireoment &nbsp;are &nbsp;familar</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and let the parents and children do the &nbsp;&nbsp;WAIS-IV	correct the dates of thier score&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;analysis the socore connection between parents and children</li></ul><p><i><b>2.how I make my case for the construct is determined &nbsp;mor by nature</b></i></p><p><b><i>If the result show that most of the family have the same level score (which the parents get the high or low scores 	the same as their offspring)&nbsp;</i></b></p><p><b><i>There is still a direct relationship between parent and offspring IQ. It is possible for genes to determine the relationship between parent and offspring IQ even if environmental factors determine the average level of each groupâ€™s IQ. Of course	 in the real world	 unlike our cartoon world	 both genes and environmental factors influence IQ	 so the relationship between parent and offspring IQ is not so easily predicted ..</i></b></p><ul><li>Although the hereditarian hypothesis is a logically possible explanation of differences between groups	 research doesnâ€™t support it.&nbsp;</li><li>Even if we cannot clearly identify the reasons for nature or nurture differences in IQ	<b>&nbsp;but according to my experiment</b>	that is show up more by nature.</li></ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;we do know that these differences can change	 just as we suggested in the Learn by Doing exercise. For example	 Dickens and Flynn&nbsp;looked at IQ scores from 1972 to 2002 and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;found a reduction in the difference between blacks and whites during this period of more than 5 IQ points	 one-third of the difference between the groups.</p><ul><li>An adoption study by Moore	looked at black children adopted into black and white families	 where the children adopted by the white families could expect to receive the benefits of greater affluence and the social and cultural support of the dominant group. On later testing	 children adopted into white families had IQs that were 13 points higher than the children adopted into black families. This is almost the entire 15 point difference reported between the two races at that time. These results and others suggest that racial differences in IQ are largely or completely the result of differences in experience. It is particularly interesting that black children measured at age 4 are only about 5 IQ points below white children of the same age	 while the group differences are about 17 points by age 24	 a finding that strongly suggests that the life experiences of black and white children may produce these diverging outcomes.</li></ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><b>&nbsp;Furthermore	 as genetics has matured as a science	 the old distinction between nature and nurture has been lost. We now understand that environmental factors influence genetic expression from the moment of conception to the end of life	 so differences between groups that differ in typical experiences are to be expected.&nbsp;</b></p> "
"Thanks for the information. It's nice to know. Unfortunately	 I think that job proposals are relevant only for US citizens. I have already finished several Coursera courses with distinction	 and I can bet that my grade on this course will be higher than 95%. However	 nobody ever applied to me with a job proposal. Once	 I wrote to a lectuter whose course I have done exceptionally well and asked whether I can come and work with him as an RA. I got no answer	 which means: ""no"". I tried to find a job in my counry after finishing some bio/statistical courses on Coursera.  I sent dozens of resumes	 but got only 2 interviews. They laughed at me  when i talked about the online education. I assume that for those who live outside of th US online courses are nothing but a pleasant hobby. "

"on learn by doing page 130 is:<br /><br />- A child drinks unsweetened iced tea for the first time	 hates it	 and then avoids drinking anything that looks like it. = accommodation<br /><br />-&nbsp;A college student who has used only Macs sits down at a PC. After spending 20 frustrating minutes&nbsp;searching for the Dock and the Finder and other Mac tools	 he walks away from the machine in disgust. = assimilation<br /><br />how is that?

can't believe someone scored me so low after at least i tried doing a good test.

"Thanks	 Khaos. It seems a replica of the experiment but written in the student's own words. &nbsp; "
I was hoping the OLI textbook can be downloaded as a pdf too. I understand the motive for striving for an interactive textbook but the textbook is giving me loading problems and I can't sit at the computer for the whole day to refresh it. I believe some of us here has work so having a copy we can bring around is very helpful.&nbsp; 
20/20. I knew for sure that about 14 of them were false and made a guess that the others were as well as I figured the professor was trying to make a point about how many commonly-believed myths there were about psychology.

"I have many disabilities	 I have not been denied this course or any part of it. It is my choice	 I am using my free will to come here and take a course to see if I can do online classes. I had to quit working when I could no longer keep up with my work so I went back to school. I was out of school for 45 years prior	 I was on oxygen	 could not even lift my books but I went to class	 even though I thought I wouldnt make it. I stayed for two years got 3 associates degrees......I would love a four year degree in sociology and thats my goal now. but I did that even with a whole lot of disabilities. and I had a 4.0 straight through	 that meant a lot	 I proved to myself I could still do something. I didnt let things stand in the way	 if I had a class I had to get to and had books and things that I couldnt lift at the time	 I found ways. I think this disability thing is a way to tell yourself its ok not to do. I believe in doing to the best of your ability myself. If this doesnt work for you I am sure you can find something out there that will	&nbsp; by looking around. Its unbelievable how much there is online to learn from now! I by the way am not knocking anyone's disabilities	 only that sometimes people like to make it an excuse for their performance. <br /> "
"Yeah	 but have you to pay for it? (signature track)<br /> "

"announcements: you will quizes after every (!) week and have a cumulative final exam. This was announced at the begining of the course together with the grading policy.<br />I did not bend any rule	 it is the staff that has changed the rules during the game. Strange.<br />A cumulative final exam. This means you will be tested the stuff of 12 weeks. So	 (35 minus 10)/(12-1) gives on average of approx. 2 questions concerning the material of each week. Inconsistent is to cover one week (12) with 13 questions. Altough the staff is free&nbsp; to do so	 but would it not be appropriate if the staff had announced that the score on week 12 material questions would be weighted so heavily in the calculation for the final grade? (I say this because evidence is found on this forum that not everybody is comfortable with calculation his/her final score.<br /><br />However	 I think	 no	 I am sure	 that the staff was not at all aware of this inconsistency (13 final questions regarding week 12 materials).<br /> "
"Of course	 and it's no rocket science. We are about to embark in a journey across an ocean of wisdom	 it's a good thing to realise how unprepared for the journey we are	 so we can pay attention to the captain of the boat	 and donÂ´t go all ""nah	&nbsp;I know everything already	&nbsp;nobody can teach me anything"".<br /><br />The pre-test was a humbling experience	 and made me feel eager to start the course.<br /><br />I scored 8	 by the way.

"Sir 	&nbsp;<br /><br />I have recently received my scores for the peer assignment.

"Fellow students	<br /><br />Am I the only one who is doing this class for the sake of learning? &nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't been in school since 1988. &nbsp;This class is free	 and it's online which means I can study whenever I want. &nbsp;I can't get any credits for it	 but I knew that before I signed up. &nbsp;The last time I went to school	 there wasn't a public internet for online courses to be on	 we didn't have laptops or cell phones or wifi	 and we sure as hell didn't have wikipedia. &nbsp;Back then	 if I had to write a paper	 I had to go to the library and look up abstracts	 pull the actual journals from the reference section	 and then photocopy the articles I needed.<br /><br />For assignment #1	 I wrote an experiment	 read it	 rewrote it	 flew it past a few other students who gave me their input and proofread it	 I rewrote it again	 and then submitted it. &nbsp;I got a 22. &nbsp;<br /><br />For assignment #2	 I have chosen schizophrenia. &nbsp;All of the information I need to write a good position paper is either in the course material or is readily available online. &nbsp;The paper has a maximum length of 1500 words; that is a seriously short paper. &nbsp;<br /><br />Seriously	 am I missing something? &nbsp;I'm not the smartest or sharpest person on the planet. &nbsp;I haven't done perfectly in this course	 but one reason I am taking it is to learn how to learn again. &nbsp;Essays and papers aren't multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank tests; I think they're much more difficult. &nbsp;A challenge is just what I was looking for when I signed up for this class. &nbsp;If I do well	 I can maybe be a PhD candidate in about ten years time.<br /><br />Respectfully	<br /><br />NAME3049100<br />Oakland	 CA	 USA "
I thoroughly enjoyed the course. Thanks a lot to all who organized the entire course delivery. Waiting for an advanced course. 
Final exam would be from10th - 23rd June . 30 questions. I ll like to know if this quiz would be a timed one or an untimed one as we generally have had till date.&nbsp;<br /><br />thanx for the help in advance&nbsp; 
"Maybe all of that will get<b>&nbsp;Mr. Anderson's&nbsp;attention	 or Alex	 or somebody</b>....&nbsp;Hopefully we will get some answers or better yet	 a <b>rubric</b>..&nbsp; "
Thanks Alex. Quiz-7 is now clear.<br /> 
"<span>If <i>heritability</i> is&nbsp;</span><span><i>the proportion of variability accounted for by genetics</i>	</span>&nbsp; can somebody explain how can culture differences determine genetics?<br /><br />My understanding is that there is <b>absolutely no relation between culture and heritability	 </b>and there for	 adding such rubric mark to the assignment is unfair to the student and also conceptually misleading.<br /><br />I think that the person writing the rubric rather meant something else	 like&nbsp;<i>Cultural differences influencing intelligence/risk of schizophrenia.</i><br /><br />To me this is (another) example of poor design with the consequence of a low effectiveness in the assessment.&nbsp; "
"I am assuming that the instructors want us to discuss how researchers have gone about determining the extent to which nature and nurture influence either intelligence or schizophrenia. In other words	 I think they want us to discuss the various types of tests and research methods that have been used to explore the genetic vs. environmental roots of intelligence or schizophrenia and what researchers have learned from that research. Like others	 I find the instructions very vague.&nbsp; Should we confine ourselves to OLI and lecture materials or should we be doing outside reading? Also	 like others	 I would very much appreciate a grading rubric.&nbsp; The rubric for Assignment #1 bore little resemblance to what some of us thought we would be graded on. More information would be very helpful.<br /><br /><br /> "

"I'm not sure if this is the right place for posting it but when I was doing the pre-test	 I was sure I had this question right but I got it wrong. 

I had been studying dreams for a year now and my answer to ""Some people donâ€™t dream."" is ""True"". Normal people will have dreams every night	 especially if they get into REM sleep. There's a chance of dreaming in NREM sleep too so even if you're not in deep sleep	 you can have dreams as well. 

However	 people with brain injuries might not dream. It's a rare symptom but it's possible. Here's a link to an article about a lady who stopped dreaming after suffering a stroke: [Click Here][1]

"No. I mean it's more difficult for them to create the secure attachment with their babies.<br /><br />It's just my intuition	 I donÂ´t know any study. "
"I donÂ´t know very well what is the ultimate reason. Perhaps I was looking a course very different from my area. <br /><br />First	 I am not a English speaker and following a whole course it would be a great opportunity to improve my English skills. Psichology is a subject wide enough and the vocabulary is large and connected to daily situations. I have to confess that presentation video was key to start the course	 Professor Anderson Smith is speaking low and clear enough in order to understand almost anything. <br /><br />Second	 I am teaching math for elementary school teachers. In order to prepare the course I had to read something&nbsp; about cognitive psychology. I got interested in these ideas and I realized my lack of psychological background. <br /><br />I am a western guy married to a eastern and maybe I can't help get interested in difference between culture. <br /><br />Do you have any idea&nbsp; the reasons why&nbsp; am I here? <br /><br />Javi<br /> "
Hi! I have a similar problem where in one of the assignments I am to evaluate the fellow student who wrote this either has misplaced the independent either the control and experimental groups. I am not sure what he/she is trying to do in the way he/she describes it. So I am a little confused on how to evaluate this work.<br />Thank you<br /> 
"Hello<br /><br />This course and the material to study were really mind-blowing! I could not stop myself in working with OLI	 despite a lot of other commitments I had in this short time. Even if another topic is not organized by Coursera	 I would gladly enroll in all this again	 because long term memory needs reinforcements	 as I again learned.<br />I applaud you	 Professor Anderson Smith	 for this excellent job	 that not only proves your dedication to teaching but also the high quality of understanding what students need (like longer time for quizzes	 exercises to better grasp and keep in mind what they just read	 and not only) for learning.<br />Many thanks.

"After getting this one wrong	 I looked at the question a little closer.&nbsp; I am	 now	 thinking that the correct answer was based on the words	 ""environmental circumstances.""&nbsp; These words makes the correct answer more understandable in my mind. "
"Impressive assigment	 Caroline. I would have given you top marks	 it's well researched and very clear. How much time did you spend?&nbsp; Mine is less scientifc	 I got just 14 points....<br /><div><div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>POSSIBLE LINK BETWEEN&nbsp;SEXUAL DRIVE&nbsp;AND IQ.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>HYPOTHESiS:</p><p>Sometimes	 when I observe the world	 I notice several&nbsp;&nbsp;stereotypes. One in particular says that people who show and above average interest in sex tend to have a lower IQ than the average population.</p><p>They tend to cheat more&nbsp;on their partners	 divorce more 	 and have more behavior problems. This group as well shows more&nbsp;cases of teenage pregnancy	 school failure and Sexual Transmitted Diseases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But is all this true	 or is just an stereotype? Is it possible to have a healthy and intense sexual life	 and at the same time a high iq? That's what I would like to find out with my experiement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>TARGET SUBJECTS</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We would start with a series of interviews to people aged between 21 to 55 years	 since they represent&nbsp;most part of the adult population. People younger than 21 could not&nbsp; yet be mature enough to know exactly how their sexuality works. Some people older than 55 could have lost interest in sex (menopause in women	 andropause in men)	 since it's already proven that hormonal changes play a huge role on sexual drive. They would come from all walks of life	 students	 housewives	 blue collar workers	 prison inmates	 Wall Street brokers	 artists	 athletes	 etc.</p><p>The questions they would have to answer	 in a totally anoymous way would be:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1- At what age did you lose your virginity? (in case you have lost it	 of course)</p><p>2- How many partners have you had?</p><p>3- How many partners would you like to have?</p><p>4- How easy for you is to reach an orgasm?</p><p>5- Rate from zero to ten your openness to try new positions	 roleplays	 and fantasies.</p><p>6- How many thoughts of a sexual nature do you have during an average day?</p><p>7- Is your libido constant	 or irregular?</p><p>8- How many times do you masturbate on an average day?</p><p>9- How often do you watch adult movies?</p><p>10- Rate from zero to ten your commintment to monogamy?</p><p>11- Is it possible love with no sex?</p><p>12 -is it possible sex with no love?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>METHOD</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Once we had the results	 we could tell two different groups apart: people with low sexual drives	 group A 	 and people with high sexial drives	 group B. We&nbsp;have our &nbsp;our independent variable: level of sexual drive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now	 we could start the experiment proper. We would rely on Magnetic Ressonance Imaging Scanner (MRI) to find how they brains works. Each subject would have to complete an IQ test while inside the MRI machine. It would be a classic IQ test	 where 100 points is the average. The MRI would record their brain bloodflow while performing the task	 recording which areas of the brain are more active (shown in the screen in red) 	 and thus demanding more oxygen.</p><p>And we are close to get our dependent variable: IQ.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>RESULTS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once each of the subjects has completed the test	 is time&nbsp;to get some results. Is there a correlation between IQ and sexual drive? If so	 members of one group should have a higher IQ than the average of the other group.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But we could find	 though	 no correlation	 so the avarage IQ of group A would be similar to group B.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>RESULTS ANALYSIS</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1- If we find there is a correlation between A (lower sex drive) and higher IQ	 we could prove the stereotype that says that brainy people tend to show no interest in sex.</p><p>2- If we find there is a correlation between B (high sex drive) and higher IQ we could prove how wrong ""social wisdom"" is.</p><p>3- If we find no correlation	 we can prove that IQ is much more complex than it looks at first sight	 and it would depend on many different factors other than sexual drive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever we find	 I think it will be a interesing finding and will help to clarify myth and reality about sex and IQ.</p></div></div> "
"Another exceptionally poor grading rubric! Given the lack of guidance in the instructions for the assignment	 my worst fears were realized when I saw the rubric. Even worse was the ""all or nothing"" grading scheme. I marked some work that ""mentioned"" the required items but did not really ""discuss"" them fully. However	 given the all or nothing marking scheme	 I had to give them the marks - somewhat unfair to those who produced a really comprehensive piece of work. There should have been a range of&nbsp; possible grades	 to properly reflect the level at which the topics were covered by the student.<br /><br />This course has been great - especially the OLI component - but the peer assessments have been dreadful!<br /> "

"Ok	 you are right. There were no multiple attemps. I was confused with another course. Sorry. Still remains the point that there was no equal relative frequency in the questions. Since	 I have a lot of minus reactions I suppose the readers agree with this fact. Let me tell you one thing: I don't care. My conclusion is that for one weird reason the scores on the Week 12 questions were more important than those for the other questions. I say weird	 since no justification is given for this fact. In test statistic it is an outlier.<br /> "
"Hi all	<br /><br />Its no where mentioned on the &nbsp;course intro page if one is going to receive the statement of accomplishment if one passes the course with minimum aggregate.<br />does that mean that only the signature track students are going to get the certificate?<br />It does not matter	 interested people are going to continue with the course anyways but it certainly boosts ones involvement.<br /><br /> "
Where can I find the certificate? Is it somewhere available for download?<br />Thanks for the course. It was very interesting.<br /> 
"First of all	 who are you to judged anyone? you should be more then happen that he is taken his time out to even teach anything. You know very well that if you were to take this course anywhere else	 you will be paying 750 dollars just for it. so you should be more then happy that this is (free) and that he is taking his time out for you to learn something.

"Hi Angelica	 If you mean the Modules in OLI	 the answer is 'NO'. Module activities in OLI do not count for Course grade.<br /> "
"Maybe to adapt to situations/environment is a bit pratical and a bit creative? Sometimes for us to adapt for&nbsp;environmental circumstances we have to be creative also	 create new ways to adapt to it	 for example to adapt to a very closed office	 without windows we can bring more lights	 have a picture of a landscape etc	 to adapt to new collegues you don't empathize you create new ways so you can deal well with them. Ok	 that practice can be present also	 I can understand that	 but I still see creative intelligence &nbsp;:S so I still think the same	I guess maybe both are right... does a situation request only one intelligence? maybe we use more than one in one only situation	 no?<br />When I have to adapt to a new&nbsp;environment I work with my imagination for ways to deal/adapt to it "
Yes I don't think we can submit if we are over the word count. Would be great to have a second box for references. well... next year...

IÂ´m with you Viviane and Filloreta. My final grade being 88.2<br /><br /> 
"Helcio	 that was my point exactly. I believe a lot of people missed this point and that is why there is so much confusion avout the grading rubric. If you outlined the process properly	 you probably did better than you think. If I remember correctly the only key word that would have gotten partial credit was Independant Variable	 otherwise we should not be simply looking for vocabulary words as some people believe. I hope you scored well.<br /> "
"I agree	 that some aspects in the assessments can be improved	 but a simple quiz definitely hadn't the same learning effect.<br />I answer the quizzes in approximitaly 2 minutes. I don't really think about it	 I read the answers and one answer usually sounds familiar	 so I take that (and until now I had always 10 of 10 points...).<br />While writing the assessment I really had to think about what I'm doing	 I recalled the topics and worked with that knowledge. I'm really proud of my experiment	 and whatever marks I get for it	 it helped me definitely more than a simple quiz.<br /><br />&gt; The peer assignment specifically says not to worry about the quality of the experiment<br />That's not true	 it was said:<br /><i>""Do not be concerned about the<b> quality of your research question</b>.""</i><br />That means	 that you should not chew over the topics of your experiment for weeks	 but concentrate more on the correct description and correct use of the terms.<br />That was the goal of that assessment: to practise the planning of an experiment.<br />For me it worked well.<br /> "
The problem for me is the grading system.&nbsp; it should provide more possible choises than 3 or 4 and 0.&nbsp; It should have at least 3 possible choises in order to avoid these kind of misinterpretation.<br />

"I want to build on&nbsp;something Caroline mentioned. I believe that the reason why people who simply listed the steps of the process will score high is because that is exactly what the professor was looking for. The instructions did say the content was not important	 but to make sure all of the components were included. I believe that the goal here was to see how many people remembered the steps	 and the rubric was designed to check for those components	 not content or presentation. "

"Let's say I conduct an experiment on bacteria? Would that be acceptable	 or the experiment has to be done with humans and/or animals? Just where do we start from? Can we just pick a random experiment we find on the internet	 change the number of subjects	 change some details and submit it as our own? I'd consider that to be a cheating.<br /><br />Also	 our knowledge of conducting an experiment should come from OLI textbook	 is that enough for this assignment? Are correlational studies also OK for this assignment? As I understand	 they are not experiments	 but just to make sure	 because these would be easier to do.<br /> "
"<p><b>Sometimes we have to assess
where we are coming from. It's not fair to get back on other students because
you were thinking you got low. I think the thing that is being measured here is
not how you change the English words but how you think critically and apply
each lesson that we learned because this is not an English course. Otherwise we
can all just use the thesaurus the whole day and change the English words.</b><span><br />
<b>&nbsp;That's why I believe that we should follow Alex. If there is no
follower to leadership	 there will be chaos. We have to respect his instruction</b><br />
<b>And remember	 the principle of getting back what you gave to the world. If
you plant hate you will reap hate likewise. If you planted love you will reap
the same. </b><br />
<b>It's a matter of using your conscience	 because we all know that there is
already a big miscommunication regarding the instructions or directions of what
should have &nbsp;been done in the assignment. Some focussed on methodology	
such as checking internal and external validity because of the word ""how
we gather the data"" makes things confusing.. Therefore	 if we will try to
be a little kinder to one another	 we don't have to be over strict with rules
and regulations. Further	 the assignments that we have submitted are not going
into major newspaper publications that we should be so strict with each other.
Second	 everyone should have been a little&nbsp;relaxed&nbsp;re. copying words
from text books or journals&nbsp;&nbsp;because of the word from Alex in first
assignment that plagiarism is not to be dealt seriously (or to that
effect).&nbsp;Therefore you should give those students some benefit of the
doubt because they are just following Alex word 	 not because they are
dishonest people.<br />
And I will recommend to Alex and the entire staff to give penalty to those
checkers who did not follow rules and regulations as to the checking of the
papers. Such as if they receive complaints as to rechecking and found out how
some people murdered the grading; that&nbsp;they should be severely penalized 	
because we were told that evaluation tasks will also be part of our grades.</b></span></p><span>

Tell me if I'm totally off here but isn't the eyes that would be interpreted as fearful eyes in the last experiment covered in the lecture n emotion eyes that would be analyzed as happy eyes in Japanese cartoons.

"Is there a source I can use to find a topic for the assignment? In the lecture on experimental method	 there is a flow-chart showing that research is often based on the conclusions of other research. Where can I look for some research topics to build my experiment upon? "

"From other Coursera's I have taken	 I know that you don't need signature track to get a certificate. The advantage is that it verifies the person named in the certificate as the one who participated in the quizzes	 or exams. They do this with a typing pattern recognition program	 I believe.

"Hi Nitin	 I would urge you to carefully read the announcement and syllabus pages.<br />Quiz-1 is long over and you can't do anything about it.

Your first weekly quiz can be sacrificed.<br />Week-1 syllabus is an independent one. You can come to it later when you have the time.<br /><br />Quiz-2 is now open and until 19th April. If by chance you studied biology earlier	 you can read through the Modules 5 to 8 in the OLI Text in a single sitting and watch the Videos of the week	 and then hit the Quiz-2. If you are new to Nervous System and Neurons	 considerable effort will be needed to read the 4 modules mentioned above. Even then you can finish them in about 4 sittings and attempt quiz-2 in time.<br /><br />Thereafter join the main stream and follow the timings of the Course. You can do it.<br /> "

"Hi there.&nbsp; From your interest in some high minded aspects of psychology I suspect you might get some good enrichment from C.G.Jung.&nbsp; Brilliant as Freud was and as much as I admire him	 he had certain limitations.&nbsp; A key limitation is I think his view of the mind as a petri dish for neurosis to be sought with determination.&nbsp; His preoccupation was with man's illness.&nbsp; Jung on the other hand held that telliological view that the mind of man exists with an a priori purpose - that of wholeness. This makes Jung's science if you will more additive than subtractive- more creative than destructive and analytical.&nbsp; Mileage varies widely on Jung and I like him quite a lot - but you might start out with a book like say- Man and His Symbols.&nbsp; My hope is that you may find it illuminating	 inspiring and refreshing as well as very informative.&nbsp; If you do like it - do let me know.<br /> "

I do not agree. Copy/paste from internet is not the assignment ! We do not need to be original to design an experiment. A kid of 5 years old can design something by himself even if it has been done before many time. The point of the assessment is to design an experiment according to certain points ( method) So of course we do not asses originality but I 'd would rather read an assessment on an alien following a proper method than someone who is simply copy and paste from internet and even put the names of the people/date.. what is the point ?<br />

"<p>From what I have understood	 creative intelligence is synonymous to divergent thinking which enables you to think out of the box and come up with many different ideas or solutions to one problem.. It means you are imaginative and can think out of the box... Practical intelligence is when you are street smart and can handle any situation efficiently by quickly understanding and adapting according to the need of the situation...</p>

"I think the reason there's more record of psychological disorder in the US is because people who have it are more accepted here.

"<p>One of the
papers I have to assess is clearly only a recap description of experiments
already done by someone else (I found several papers about it in google scholarâ€¦
I wonâ€™t name the experiments to respect the privacy of the student). It even
describes the results already found	 instead of forming an hypothesis of what
he/she expects to find with the experiment	 is only describing the results
already foundâ€¦ although	 to be fair	 this donâ€™t seem to be just a â€œcopy-pasteâ€
but still itâ€™s not an hypothesis but just a description of results already
found.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Does this count
as cheating or just a severe lack of originality? What about the fact that
there is no hypothesis and no prediction in the paper	 but just a description
of results? </p>

These questions include &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;how many types of intelligence there are	 the role of nature versus nurture in intelligence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But first of all 	 we must begin by<b>&nbsp;defining intelligence</b>.</p><ul><li>Doing so is not an easy task	 but a group of 52 intelligence researchers conrred on this general definition: Inteligence is a very general mental capability that	among other things	involve the ability to reason	plan	solve problem	think abstractly	 conprehend complex ideas 	 learn quickly and&nbsp;</li><li>Today	 most psychologists define&nbsp;intelligence&nbsp;as&nbsp;<i>a&nbsp;</i><i>mental ability consisting of the ability to learn from experience	 solve problems	 and use knowledge to adapt to new situations</i>.arn from experience.</li></ul><p><i><b>2.the aspect of psychology does intelligence apply</b></i></p><p>&nbsp; Psychometrics is the field of psychology that specializes in mental testing in any of its facetsï¼Œincluding personality assessment	intelligence evaluation	and aptitude measurement.</p><p><i><b>3.the attitude of various psychologists</b></i></p><ul><li>Charles spearman &nbsp; carry out an early and influential application of factor analysis in the domain of intelligence.</li><li>Binet and Simon &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;<i>construct that the different abilities and skills measured on intelligence tests have in common</i>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<span>general intelligence<b>&nbsp;factor (g)</b></span><b>.</b></li><li>Lewis Terman &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span>there is also evidence for<i>&nbsp;</i></span><span><b>specific intelligence</b>&nbsp;(s)</span><span>	&nbsp;<i>a measure of specific skills in narrow domains</i>.F</span><span>luid intelligence	 which refers to&nbsp;<i>the capacity &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to learn new ways of solving problems and performing activities</i>	 and<b>&nbsp;crystallized intelligence</b>	 which refers to&nbsp;<i>the accumulated knowledge of the world we have &nbsp; &nbsp;acquired throughout our lives</i>.</span></li><li>J.P.Guilford &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;used factor analysis to examine the demands of mant intelligence-related tasks.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;Sternberg &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;his triarchic theory of intelligence	 including the three different kinds of reasoning processes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><b>4.some conclusions</b></i></p><ul><li>We have seen that contemporary concepttions of intelligence reject the narrow linking of a &nbsp;score on an IQ test with a person's intelligence.Even so 	IQ test remain the most frequent measure of ""intelligence"" in Westtern society.Research has shown that children	 particularly children from low socioeconomic groups	 can improve in IQ if they are placed in an enriched prekindergarten program and then in an elementary school of sufficient quality to maintain these gains.Sadly	 if children are only placed in enriched preschools	 but later attend academically poor elementary schools	 their IQ gains diminish or even disappear.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp;There are many ways that experience can influence intelligence. Socioeconomic status (i.e.	 income and social opportunities) can affect the type of neighborhood a person can afford to live in	 the quality of schooling and likelihood of preschool educational opportunities	 and likelihood of taking advantage of educational activities (e.g.	 visiting museums and historical sites). Differences in parental education levels can have a huge impact. For instance	 Hart and Risley<span>&nbsp;</span>studied interactions between adults and children in families differing in socioeconomic status and education. This was not a race difference study. They found that children of professional-level parents heard three times as many words and far more complex and unusual words than did children of unemployed parents	 and children of working-class parents heard twice as many words as the children of unemployed parents. Although a word count like this may seem unimportant	 exposure to language is very important for development of communication skills and categories of knowledge.</li></ul><h2>part II</h2><div>In my opinion 	the intelligence is more determine by nature. So	 I can design an experiment to make a provement for that.</div><p><i><b><br /></b></i></p><p><i><b>1.the methods that we collect data to address the issue&nbsp;</b></i></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such as&nbsp;The Wechsler Adult lntelligence Scale (WAIS)	which &nbsp;is the most widely used intelligence test for adults. The current version of the WAIS	 called the WAIS-IV	 was standardized on 2	200 people ranging from 16 to 90 years of age. It consists of 15 different tasks	 each designed to assess intelligence	 including working memory	 arithmetic ability	 spatial ability	 and general knowledge about the world (see the figure below). The WAIS-IV yields scores on four domains: verbal	 perceptual	 working memory	 and processing speed. The&nbsp;reliability&nbsp;of the test is high (more than 0.95)	 meaning that&nbsp;when a person is assessed at different times on the test	 the person will score approximately the same every time with more than a 95% accuracy rate.&nbsp;</p><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i><b>the key of the experiment&nbsp;</b></i></span></p><ul><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; set about 3 groups &nbsp;perticipants(parents with their children )	each group have 1000 family. and pick the families from socity envireoment &nbsp;are &nbsp;familar</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and let the parents and children do the &nbsp;&nbsp;WAIS-IV	correct the dates of thier score&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;analysis the socore connection between parents and children</li></ul><p><i><b>2.how I make my case for the construct is determined &nbsp;mor by nature</b></i></p><p><b><i>If the result show that most of the family have the same level score (which the parents get the high or low scores 	the same as their offspring)&nbsp;</i></b></p><p><b><i>There is still a direct relationship between parent and offspring IQ. It is possible for genes to determine the relationship between parent and offspring IQ even if environmental factors determine the average level of each groupâ€™s IQ. Of course	 in the real world	 unlike our cartoon world	 both genes and environmental factors influence IQ	 so the relationship between parent and offspring IQ is not so easily predicted ..</i></b></p><ul><li>Although the hereditarian hypothesis is a logically possible explanation of differences between groups	 research doesnâ€™t support it.&nbsp;</li><li>Even if we cannot clearly identify the reasons for nature or nurture differences in IQ	<b>&nbsp;but according to my experiment</b>	that is show up more by nature.</li></ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;we do know that these differences can change	 just as we suggested in the Learn by Doing exercise. For example	 Dickens and Flynn&nbsp;looked at IQ scores from 1972 to 2002 and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;found a reduction in the difference between blacks and whites during this period of more than 5 IQ points	 one-third of the difference between the groups.</p><ul><li>An adoption study by Moore	looked at black children adopted into black and white families	 where the children adopted by the white families could expect to receive the benefits of greater affluence and the social and cultural support of the dominant group. On later testing	 children adopted into white families had IQs that were 13 points higher than the children adopted into black families. This is almost the entire 15 point difference reported between the two races at that time. These results and others suggest that racial differences in IQ are largely or completely the result of differences in experience. It is particularly interesting that black children measured at age 4 are only about 5 IQ points below white children of the same age	 while the group differences are about 17 points by age 24	 a finding that strongly suggests that the life experiences of black and white children may produce these diverging outcomes.</li></ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><b>&nbsp;Furthermore	 as genetics has matured as a science	 the old distinction between nature and nurture has been lost. We now understand that environmental factors influence genetic expression from the moment of conception to the end of life	 so differences between groups that differ in typical experiences are to be expected.&nbsp;</b></p> "
"<p>I disagree with the idea to make the quizzes simplier (after all we came here to learn). However	 I vote for extending the content of the course (i.e. adding more mini lectures).  OLI book shows that the content is huge	 while Dr. Smith covers about 30% of it. 
I am taking two more courses in parallel (Dan Ariely + physiology) and both courses are much more demanding than this one. I came here to listen to what Dr. Smith has to say. I like his explanations and the way he covers the matherial. </p>

"Exactly Nancy	 they should have given specific guidelines about what is the grading criteria for the Assignment	 even in the new assignment they HAVE NOT YET MENTIONED THE GRADING CRITERIA. Students will do whatever they think is correct then they will be given bad grades	 then they will be failed. In order to get a certificate they will pay again and again	 that is a great money making strategy but very unethical. "

"My experience with this course so far has been excellent	 so I was hugely disappointed to see such a poor evaluation rubric for the peer-assessment section of the assignment. For instance...<br /><br /><ul><li>No evaluation of actual presentation (as in grammar	 syntax	 organization	 clarity	 etc).</li><li>Evaluation scale makes no real sense. For example	 in the first criteria	 the grades you can assign are either 5	 3	 2 and 0	 whereas in another one they're 5	 4	 2 and 0 and in the last one just 3 and 0. What gives with the missing numbers? This really distorts the final tally.</li><li>And&nbsp;<b>most importantly	 no comment box</b>. This is without a doubt the most important feedback section and it's completely absent in the assessment for no discernible reason.</li></ul><br />Did anybody else get this impression? I hope this is fixed for the next assignment; the rest of the course has really been very good. "
"Well	 I guess I'll have to be the ""darker""of these posts for the following reason. I have been doing some personal research on the history of the use of psychology in the American school system starting from the 1800's under german influence	 Dr. Wundt would be one. I'll quickly end this post by suggesting a book entitled ""The Leipzig Connection"" by Paolo Lionni. It's a short book...it can be read in an hour or less. If it doesn't make you take a hard look at psychology then nothing will. "

I enjoyed the little personal references&nbsp; (your grandchildren	 4-H	 etc.) you threw in the video lectures every now and then. It made the lectures and you seem a bit more real. Will you be offering the course again? I would jump at a chance to take it again! Again	 a big thanks to everyone who made this course possible!<br /> "

If there is a new evaluation of assignments I would like to send Assignment I because mine (I donÂ´t know why) was nos send/received Thanks a Lot&nbsp; 
"Yeah	 I could use some suggestions as well on the written assignment. It said it just has to have experimental method like I guess independent/dependent variables	 a control/manipulated etc. I went back to I think module 3 and did some research about the experimental method. But the assignment calls for&nbsp;5 steps to the assignment. Anyway	 I just need a little help. "
"Same for Australia	 nothing here and its 6pm MOnday night<br /> "
I just read the mail from Alex informing that Quiz for Week 1 has been extended by a day until 8:00 am EDT on April 6.<br /><br />That explains. 
"<p>If you ask the 2 groups of people to fill up a questionnaire and then manipulate the independent variable and then ask them to fill up the questionnaire again	 before the manipulation was done the group will act as a control group and after the manipulation is done	 the same group will act as the experiment group... However am not sure why you are starting off with two groups then....
Your questionnaire will be the tool to measure the dependent variable.. You will have to provide an operational definition though...</p>
 "
"Yes I take notes when reading the OLI it helps to solidify the material I am reading and gives&nbsp;succinct reference notes so I am not overwhelmed when revision time comes around	 it is also handy to have physical notes&nbsp;which are easy to flip through at will and more readily available than the OLI text. "
"What you have written here is very well though out	 clear and insightful; I imagine that&nbsp;the points you have&nbsp;made in your paper were equally clear and thoughtful. Perhaps&nbsp;following your guidelines	 you would have received a very good grade on your paper. <br /><br />With that said	 I think that you may have misinterpeted what the assignment was about	 and&nbsp;although you&nbsp;probably did an excellent&nbsp;job writing what you though was important	&nbsp;after seeing the rubric&nbsp;you should now understand that&nbsp;the purpose of this particular paper was to show how well you learned and understand&nbsp;the process of setting up an experiment	 using the methods learned.<br /><br /> Properly laying out the steps and listing&nbsp;key words are very important when explaining what you have learned. If you&nbsp;outlined these steps and used the terminology that you learned	 you will score high. If you did not	 you made a mistake and the rubric will not work.<br /><br />Understanding where you went wroung is an important part for learning.<br /><br />Bottom line is that there are no A's for effort at the college level; you either did it the way the professor wanted it or you did not. "
"Thanks Alex	 I worked so hard	 I guess if the class is offered again I will have to try a little harder next time. I do appreciate the the class and I recieved so much from it. Thanks to everyone involved in making this happen. "
"Referring back to the original post of this thread	 in which Michel discussed the fact that our peers were not trained assessors	 I should point out that most university teaching staff (much less TA's) are not actually qualified as teachers or assessors either. However	 they do have the benefit of working within an academic environment in which they can consult with others	 review the results and bell curves of their assessments and (hopefully) develop some skills in these areas by experience. Our peers	 however	 do not. Some of our peers may actually be more qualified in assessment than the course staff	 while others may never have assessed anything in their lives - which makes peer assessment a complete lottery.<br /><br /> "
"G Varsha Bargavi The second assignment has not been posted yet. When it is	 I expect the deadline will be posted at the same time. <br /> "
"Kamini	 Don't lose hope. Right now	 you can give a miss to Week-1 lessons and quiz-1 since only 10 out of 11 quizzes are going to be reckoned for grades. If a student attends all the 11 quizzes	 the one with the least score will be dropped. In your case	 let it be the Quiz-1 since the deadline is already over.<br /><br />Quiz-2 is now open and available until 19th April. Try to allot maximum time for OLI Text and read Modules 5 to 8. Watch the videos for the Second week. And of course	 the slides (pdf). Set your target date for Quiz-2 to be 14th April. It is possible. From 15th onwards you can join the main stream and continue with Week-3 lessons and quiz-3.<br /><br />Later	 when you find time	 you can get back to Week-1 lessons and Modules 1 to 4. They cover History and Research methods.<br /><br />Prof Smith	 Prof Alex and colleagues have devised a very fine course for unknown students all over the world. The OLI Text is another bounty. We may not get a similar course in the near future to teach us Psychology as a Science. I urge you not to miss this opportunity. You can continue and hit the goal post.<br /> "

<li>I wonder if the anti-violence learning that appeared at the &quot;clockwork orange&quot; can be replicated in the real life? I mean that aggressive violence and defensive violence are controlled by different brain regions. Thus	 why shall the learned response to the aggressive violence be generalized towards the defensive violence?</li>
<li>Professor Anderson said that classical condition merely involves the learning of new associations between stimulus and response. Right? Suppose	 A girl was flying to Rome while watching a new movie. By her side was sitting a wonderful boy and they fell in love. They were dating for a week	 and then have never seen each other again. According to Pavlovian conditioning (from the girl perspective) Us - the boy Ur - falling in love Cs - movie (and the flight to Rome) Cr - falling in love</li>
</ol>
<p>However	 she does not fell in love every time she watches that movie. Not at all :-) she feels nostalgy	 she misses him	 but it&#39;s not love. Thus the cr is a new response. New association and new response. </p>

"I think Gal has come the closest to answering the question by saying	 ""To show that psychological research is highly relevant to our everyday lives and discussions."" However	 I would take is a step further	 based on Prof. Wilson's Lecture 1.2 <i>Analysis of Pre-Test</i>. Research is not only relevant	 it is the only way to prove a theory to be true	 and this is what has brought psychology into the mainstream of science. For instance	 I can believe that opposites attract based on my experience and the experience of so many around me. But if research has not been done to show that to be true	 then I am just expressing an opinion. If research shows that to not be true	 then I can assume that my view is skewed by the anticdotal ""evidence"" of those around me and I need to re-frame my position based on real the real evidence from the research. "

"I haven't seen the guiltiness Alex gave last week	 and off course like all of you I feel a bit bitter to have worked so much and tied to polish my bad English ( I am not native) for discovering that 10% of the work was necessary. But in truth I don't regret it because I learnt a lot about schizophrenia and I worked on my english	 which was was I expected from the class. I did't this unit to talk about about nature vs nurture for 150 words and I've always like reading papers about twin studies. So well.

In my opinion there are some things to be clarified.<br />1. First of all&nbsp; should we use only texts from the OLI textbook or we have to search articles in Internet? And if we found some interesting articles it is obligatory to write references? the refernces must be put&nbsp; at the end of our essay?<br />2. We have to support only one aspect (nature or nurture) or we may support and write evidences for both aspects? <br />3. We must suggest an experimental method or we have&nbsp; only to provide the results of other previous experiments?<br />4. At the end we have to reach to a conclusion that support one of the two aspects or should we be neutral?<br />5. Should we give a definition for intelligence or schizophrenia at the beginning of essay or not?<br /><br />My apologies for my poor english<br /> 
Same. Final was not calculated into the final score.

I am looking forward to meeting new friends while learning and hoping I can stick to finish the whole course. "

"Hello Tara	<br /><br />The instructions are clear. Prof Smith has confirmed elsewhere that there is no need for us to conduct the experiment. Our job is to design an experiment to study behavior and present it in the format he taught us in the first week. If you can actually perform your design and come up with results	 I think	 none will complain.<br /><br />If a student exceeds the mandate	 it pleases the teacher ... :-)<br /><br />All the very best to you.<br /> "
Please if someone can advise on how to get my paper re-evaluated because i got a 2 out of the 23 which I feel is wrong since I at least turned in the assignment and tried my best. &nbsp;please also if the STAFF can advise me on this also.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br /> 
"As I understand it	 you receive a Statement of Accomplishment even if you don't join the Signature Track.

"Good day :) My name is NAME2093324 (or Sasha shortly)	 I am almost 25.

"Hello	<br /><br />I really appreciate the way of learning OLI offers	 especially the possibility of testing yourself at the end of each chapter. In order to check myself before I attempt a quiz	 I'd like to do the ""Did I get this"" and other tests in a second or maybe third run without reading all the texts in between. The main idea is that I simply refresh my knowledge e.g of chapter 9-12 after I already have worked at them. Using this method may show some gaps in my knowledge and I could prepare more specific on those before attempting the quiz. Is this ""set back"" possible	 e.g. that I ""erase"" my done work from chapter 9 to work on it again? <br /> "
"Quizes: (103/11) x 0.3 = 2.81<br />Assignments: (23/25 + 12/15) x 10 x 0.5 x 0.4 = 3.44 <br />Final exam: 32/35 x 10 x 0.3 = 2.74<br />Grand total: 8.99.<br />Is 89	9%. Since the calculation uses discrete numbers without decimals behind the point	 I suppose this will be a 90% and I have passed with distinction.<br /> "
"I&nbsp;agree somewhat: the course was&nbsp;excellent apart from the last peer assessment.&nbsp;My three evaluations are based on my own rubric (i.e.	 relative effort expended)	 because the instructors were aparently unable to develop a rubric which was consistent with the assignment (or even clear	 for that matter). Fortunately	 I only took this course to learn more about psychology	 not to get a fair grade. I certainly wouldn't ever consider&nbsp;paying for a Coursera course based on this experience. "
"<p>Hi... Forming associations can really help change behaviour... For eg. If u feel u use too many abusive words while talking	 try pinching yourself everytime u use one( nothing that hurts but just a light pinch).. After a few times	 everytime u would want to use an abusive word you will be reminded of the pinch and hence u will refrain from using it...</p>

"Hey	 I hope you are feeling better by now!

"Dear Sin Wai Man	 I am reproducing from the Video Lecture 2.1<br />""if it's all or none how does the neuron code information about intensity? I can tell if I have light touch and I have a much&nbsp; larger touch some of that of course is the number of neurons that are stimulated. NAME487897ut the neuron itself can actually code information about intensity by when it can fire again. There's a very slight refractory period as it's returning down to&nbsp; resting potential and then you can see it's actually below the 70 millivolts and slowly goes up to the resting potential. And if it's an intense stimulus	 I can fire earlier in that period after the action potential. So	 it codes things by the frequency of firing. Here you see a half second	 or really about 1 and a half seconds at threshold it's firing. If I have a 160% of the threshold intensity is firing faster rate	 and at 270% of the threshold intensity	 it's firing even faster	 even a greater rate. So the frequency of firing really is determined by the intensity of the stimulation on the neuron""<br />It is clear that the neuron can repeat-fire in cases of more and more intensity. NAME487897ut	 there is nothing like strong firing. It is	 as stated earlier	 all or none.<br /><br /> "

"Sorry anonymous	 I think it is better to seperate the first 10 of the final exam from the final exam score and let them be a normal quiz score in order to make the final exam more balanced or alligned as a cumulative exam. I had 3 wrong answer in the first 10 questions	 but still a 32/35 that is above the distinction treshold.<br />7/10 would below the treshold	 but could be dropped as the lowest score. Even if it was not dropped it would only weighted for 1/12 x 7 x 0.3 = 0.175 in the final grade. Not a lot	 just 1	75%. Without drop it would weighted for 7/35 x 10 x 0.3 = 0.6 (= 6%). Why weight the scores on the week 12 material 3.42 more than a normal quizz score?<br /><br />For the ones who score low on week 12 question this could make a difference: passing or not. Since no justification is giving for this unequal treatment of the scores on the week 12 questions I was just wondering why it is the case. Does anybody know? Was it deliberately arranged this way or an unforeseen consequence of the calculation formula? <br /> "

the human brain so special? Sure it's big â€” but it's far from the biggest brain

The human brain contains roughly 100 billion neurons [Ed. note: <a href=""http://io9.com/5890414/the-4-biggest-myths-about-the-human-brain"" target="""">closer to 86-billion</a>	 actually	 but now 
we're just being nitpicky]. Each of these neurons seems capable of making around 
1	000 connections	 representing about 1	000 potential synapses	 which largely do 
the work of data storage. Multiply each of these 100 billion neurons by the 
approximately 1	000 connections it can make	 and you get 100 trillion data 
points	 or about 100 terabytes of information.</span>
<p>The reasoning 
behind the 100-terabyte estimate has its flaws. It assumes	 for example	 that 
each synapse stores 1 byte of information. In reality	 each one could 
conceivably store more or less than that. Consider	 for example	 that a synapse 
can exist in more states than either on or off. <a href=""http://io9.com/5860537/scientists-have-created-a-computer-chip-that-could-one-day-artificially-boost-your-brain-power"" target="""">As we've explained previously</a>:</p><span>Related

Your basic synapse is a connection between two neurons: a presynaptic neuron	 
and a postsynaptic neuron. Presynaptic neurons release neurotransmitters	 which 
dock with receptors on the postsynaptic neuron and activate what are known as 
ion channels in the postsynaptic cell membrane.
Ion channels are like a neuron's gatekeepers; they allow charged atoms such 
as sodium	 potassium and calcium into and out of the cell	 and are thought to 
play an important role in the regulation of synaptic plasticity	 i.e. the 
strengthening or weakening of neuronal connections over time.
All this is to say that when neurons talk to one another	 <b>there's 
more regulating their communication than a simple on/off 
switch</b>.</span>
<p>Most of the 
computer chips that we use to model brain activity operate in this binary 
fashion â€“ but the brain probably doesn't work this way. </p>
<p>Consider	 also	 
that synapses are often interdependent	 and will rely on one another to convey a 
single piece of information. While it's logical to assume that the brain's 
extensive neural networks <a href=""http://io9.com/5832085/ibms-neurosynaptic-chips-are-the-closest-thing-to-a-synthetic-brain-yet"" target="""">greatly improve its processing speed</a> (a

6.4*1018 instructions per second that human kind [could] carry out on 
its general purpose computers in 2007"")	 it's also possible that they do so at 
the expense of storage capacity. Then again	 Northwestern University

... neurons combine so that each one helps with many memories at a time	 
exponentially increasing <b>the brainâ€™s memory storage capacity to 
something closer to around 2.5 petabytes</b> [1 petabyte â‰ˆ 1	000 
terabytes]. For comparison	 if your brain worked like a digital video recorder 
in a television	 2.5 petabytes would be enough to hold three million hours of TV 
shows. You would have to leave the TV running continuously for more than 300 
years to use up all that storage.</span>
<p>So	 which is it? 
One terabyte? 100 terabytes? 2.5-thousand terabytes? Or can you fit an entire 
human consciousness into just 300 megabytes (approximately 60 3-minute MP3s)	 <a href=""http://io9.com/5202459/caprica-script-reveals-how-many-brains-you-can-store-on-an-ipod"" target="""">as suggested in an episode of Caprica?</a> 
Perhaps these questions are irrelevant. As Reber himself says: ""<b>if 
</b>your brain worked like a digital video recorder	 2.5 petabytes would be 
enough to hold three million hours of TV shows."" We've already established that 
our brains <i>don't</i> work like DVRs	 or the vast majority of computers	 for 
that matter	 and so down the rabbit hole we go: how much brain-space does a 
memory occupy? Does a more detailed memory take up more space than a foggy one? 
Have forgotten memories been deleted	 or have they been relegated to some 
forgotten subfolder in the dusty corners of your consciousness? Does a deeply 
rooted	 subconscious bias take up more space than a transient dream? Is each 
encoded in different file format? And while we're exploring the

"Today's Wall Street Journal features a scary article on ADHD. &nbsp;DSM-V (which we learned in Week 11 replaced DSM-IV last month) is expected to make it ""easier to diagnose"" a child or adult as having the disorder and inevitably to prescribe more Adderall or Ritalin. &nbsp;Here's the article:<br /><br /><b><i>A Nation of Kids on Speed</i></b><div><div><a target=""""></a>
<p>By Pieter Cohen and Nicholas Rasmussen</p><p>Walk into any American high school and nearly one in five boys in the 
hallways will have a diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention	 11% of all American 
children ages 4 to 17â€”over six millionâ€”have ADHD	 a 16% increase since 2007. 
When you consider that in Britain roughly 3% of children have been similarly 
diagnosed	 the figure is even more startling. Now comes worse news: In the U.S.	 
being told that you have ADHDâ€”and thus receiving some variety of amphetamine to 
treat itâ€”has become more likely. </p><a target=""""></a>
<p>Last month	 the American Psychiatric Association released the fifth edition 
of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disordersâ€”the bible of mental 
healthâ€”and this latest version	 known as DSM-5	 outlines a new diagnostic 
paradigm for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Symptoms of ADHD remain 
the same in the new edition: ""overlooks details	"" ""has difficulty remaining 
focused during lengthy reading	"" ""often fidgets with or taps hands"" and so on. 
The difference is that in the previous version of the manual	 the first symptoms 
of ADHD needed to be evident by age 7 for a diagnosis to be made. In DSM-5	 if 
the symptoms turn up anytime before age 12	 the ADHD diagnosis can be made. 
</p><a target=""""></a>
<p>It's also easier to diagnose adult ADHD. Before	 adults needed to exhibit six 
symptoms. Now	 five will do. These changes will undoubtedly fuel increased 
prescriptions of the drugs that doctors use to treat ADHD: stimulants such as 
Ritalin and Adderall.</p>

<p>Even before DSM-5	 doctors were already on track to prescribe enough 
stimulants this year for each American man	 woman and child to receive the 
equivalent of 130 mg of amphetamine (about 40 five-mg pills of Adderall) and an 
even greater amount of the very similar drug Ritalin. In this era of excessive 
prescribing	 we seem to have forgotten the cautionary history of amphetamines in 
Americaâ€”a history that shows how overprescribing stimulants leads to widespread 
dependence and addiction.</p><a target=""""></a>
<p>Since their introduction by the pharmaceutical company Smith	 Kline &amp; 
French in 1937	 amphetamines have been prescribed for maladies that had more to 
do with societal expectations than genuine mental illness. American soldiers 
received stimulants during World War II to boost morale and improve performance 
in combat. </p><a target=""""></a>
<p>Meantime	 back at home	 amphetamine was heralded as the first antidepressant	 
and shortly thereafter	 as an ideal weight-loss pill. One 1955 advertisement for 
AmPlus amphetamine tablets assured users that they would be ""beachable by 
summer."" Decades would pass until research demonstrated the lack of long-term 
benefit for most cases of depression and weight loss	 but the lack of proof 
didn't hold doctors back from liberally prescribing stimulants to millions of 
housewives in postwar suburbs. </p><a target=""""></a>
<p>By 1969	 doctors were prescribing the equivalent of 120 mg of amphetamine for 
each Americanâ€”a high-water mark of per-capita consumption we are only now about 
to surpass. By then	 the addictive potential of prescription stimulants had 
attracted intense scientific and public scrutiny as evidence grew that many 
patients were becoming dependent on the drugs. Thirty percent of patients in one 
study conducted in New York state admitted to using their medications 
recreationally. Millions of people without prescriptions easily obtained 
diverted pills. </p><a target=""""></a>
<p>In 1968	 the National Academy of Sciences organized an authoritative 
investigation into the stimulants' true benefits and risks. The consensus: These 
drugs had limited efficacy and real harms. Medical experts discouraged the use 
of stimulants for both depression and obesity	 but the warnings had little 
effect on doctors' prescribing habits until the Controlled Substances Act of 
1971 mandated that stimulants be placed in a tightly controlled category of 
medications	 referred to as Schedule II. </p><a target=""""></a>
<p>Doctors were free to prescribe the drugs but had to report each prescription. 
Almost overnight	 prescriptions for stimulants to treat depression and obesity 
plummeted: Medical use dropped 90% between 1969 and 1972.</p><a target=""""></a>
<p>Just when it seemed that amphetamine's days were numbered	 doctors began to 
embrace the drug for treating Hyperkinetic Reaction of Childhoodâ€”what we now 
call ADHD. (It became the official name in 1987.) Concern about dependence and 
addiction	 along with the watchful eye of the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration	 kept prescriptions for ADHD at low levels during the 1970s. 
</p><a target=""""></a>
<p>But by the 1990s	 experts and advocacy groups for ADHD	 some funded by 
pharmaceutical companies	 began to argue that stimulants did not lead to 
addiction when treating children for the disorder	 and that the stimulants 
actually decreased the risk of future drug abuse. Their main argument was that 
ADHD itself is a significant risk factor for future substance abuse	 and that 
stimulants	 by treating the underlying illness	 also reduced the likelihood of 
future drug use. Concerned parents were told that starting their children on 
stimulants when young would decrease the risks of future trouble with alcohol 
and drugs.</p><a target=""""></a>
<p></p><a target=""""></a>
<p>The problem with this reassuring message is that it was based on flimsy 
evidence. Experts had relied on studies of children treated with stimulants by 
their personal physicians	 compared with children who had ADHD but did not 
receive stimulants. These community studies were fraught with confounding 
variables and were only suggestive.</p><a target=""""></a>
<p>Three months ago	 the only randomized trial to study future substance abuse 
by ADHD kids refuted the notion that stimulants	 when taken in childhood	 have a 
protective effect. Investigators found strong evidence that ADHD itself in fact 
predisposes children to later substance abuseâ€”but no evidence that stimulant 
medication reduces this rate any better than treating ADHD with behavioral 
approaches. Further evidence that stimulants do not protect children from 
addiction was provided in a comprehensive review published last month in JAMA 
Psychiatry.</p><a target=""""></a>
<p>We still do not have a single randomized trial to help determine if starting 
stimulants as an adolescent or adult further increases the risk of future 
substance abuse	 although the long and checkered history of medical stimulants 
would suggest it does. Certainly	 the risks from recreationally using stimulants 
are already well-documented.</p><a target=""""></a>
<p>In 2010	 Adderall was second only in popularity to the painkiller Vicodin as 
a prescription drug of abuse among high-school seniors	 according to the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse. Adolescents often perceive prescription drugs 
as safer than illicit ones	 but abusing prescription amphetamines can lead to 
seizures	 psychosis and life-threatening heart disease.</p><a target=""""></a>
<p>Stimulants can certainly benefit some young children with truly disabling 
ADHD. However	 history has already taught us that overprescribing stimulants to 
millions of Americans leads to dependence	 addiction and overdose. By medicating 
children for wiggling in their chairs	 losing their homework and shouting out 
answers	 we are not teaching them vital coping skills to manage their behavior. 
Instead	 we are teaching them to take a pill. One day	 we'll look back and 
wonder: Why did we do this? Again.</p>

So they were added up then divided by the number of people I was graded by... but got only whole numbers? Because the one assessment shown was the exact grade I got. 
"Thanks Hal!

Glad to know OLI is working on a Flash-free version. From what I can tell	 OLI looks pretty cool. "
"Thanks guys	<br /><br />I feel frustrated. I managed to do pretty well throughout the course (quizzes and assignments) and now I face I can't get the statement of accomplishment because of a 0.03 which would be no problem if I had done the exam on Tuesday.<br /><br /><br /> "
"Mr Alex	<br />Many students are getting anxious about the error message in the 'Peer Assessments' page and opening new threads to express their despair in the forum.<br /><br />I request you to kindly replace the error message with a notification asking the students to be patient and to wait for the announcement in due course.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /> "
"Did you actually evaluate it? &nbsp;Chances are the student just didn't complete the assignment. &nbsp;I evaluated two incomplete assignments	 although they had managed to finish the sentence! &nbsp;I suspect you will need to finish the evaluation before you can move on to another paper. &nbsp;I managed to give 2 points for the most incomplete one I assessed. &nbsp; "
No 
Good find Michelle. Thank you :) 
"Thank you!<br /><br />I'd like to join in the chorus of 'thank you's'.<br /><br />I found the course highly informative and the lectures in particular were easily understood.<br />Sometimes it's easy to forget just how incredibly knowledgeable some of our lecturers are	 and the skill required at time to take the complex	 and 'dumb it down' to bite sized learning blocks. &nbsp;Please	 that is not to say we are dumb	 but if we were flying at the level of our lecturers	 then we would not be their students.<br /><br />Thank you Dr Smith and to your team for the time you took for this online course	 which I'm sure is well above and beyond your initial job description. &nbsp;<br /><br />My appreciation to you all.<br /><br />Mike "
The individuals in the above mentioned video seem to be acting. I believe the researcher in Wernicke's aphasia presentation is also the patient in Broca's aphasia presentation. I am wondering if this video is included in OLI textbook by mistake or because the illustrations closely resemble the real cases. 
"Now that the final exam is closed	 I can say that 99.7% rounds to 100% and that is the correct answer for the 3rd standard deviation. &nbsp; "
"Alfiya	<br />I would have definitely given you a better score. From all the postings in the forums	 it appears peer reviews are not consistent. It isn't always clear why some people got good or bad scores. It probably depends on how much the reviewer &nbsp;liked and understood the assignment	 and on how honest they are. I tend to be on the generous side	 perhaps because I myself am a teacher. If an assignment is going in the right direction	 whether it's got everything or not	 I reward. And	 you obviously put a lot of work in your research. Good teachers guide	 empower and motivate students	 they don't chastise them.<br />I train animals too. The trick is ""set them up for success""	 and if they go wrong	 it's the trainer's fault. It is the trainer who has to go back and understand where he went wrong.&nbsp;<br /><br /> "
"<p>The first part is correct. Initial visual input comes to the occipital lobe	 however later on visual information is processed by the temporal lobe (e.g.recognition of faces) and the pariental lobe (e.g.	 eye hand coordination). 
As for the second part	 I don&#39;t know what the temporal lobe may to do with balance. But maybe I miss something. </p>

Violence : A Cause for Aggression in the Youth today?<br />
<br />
</span></span></b></p>

<p>Children have been entertained by animated films and
television shows for over 80 years. The first true animated star was the 1920s
icon	 Felix the Cat. Within the next 10 years	 characters developed by the
Disney Brothers' Cartoon Studios	 such as Mickey Mouse	 Donald Duck	 and Pluto
had become international celebrities and their movies were generating millions
of dollars. In fact	 Disney's first full feature length film	 Snow White and
the Seven Dwarfs	 is still one of the top ten grossing films of all time	 when
adjusted for inflation (Box Office Mojo.com	 2004). By the 1950s	 the
violence-laden cartoon	 Popeye the Sailor	 was drawing a large television
audience. Following the success of Popeye	 studios such as Hannaâ€“Barbera began
to produce The Flinstones and other made-for-TV animated series (see Kirsh	
2006 for a more detailed review of the history of violence in the media).
Currently	 animated film classics and new television series can be seen on
cable/satellite channels	 such as Boomerang	 Cartoon Network	 and The Disney Channel.
Moreover	 feature films staring animated characters are still box office
juggernauts. For instance	 in 2004	 Shrek 2 generated nearly $900 billion in
international box office receipts and billions more in home DVD sales
(BoxOffice Mojo.com	 2004).</p>

<p><b>Violent
elements in cartoons</b></p>

<p><span>Violence in cartoons is an integral part of cartoon
content. In fact	 frequency of violence in cartoons is higher than in
live-action dramas or comedies (Potter &amp; Warren	 1998). As a consequence	
youth are more likely to view media depicted violence during Saturday morning
cartoons than during prime-time television hours (8:00â€“11:00 P.M.;Gerbner	
Gross	 Morgan	 &amp; Signorelli	 1994). However	 there are qualitative
differences between the acts of violence depicted during live-action dramas and
those depicted in cartoons. Cartoon violence meant for a youthful audience (as opposed
to animated films for adults	 such as Heavy Metal) tend to involve minor acts
of violence: realistically portrayed death is rarely shown and graphic acts of
violence are seldom televised. Additionally	 cartoons sanitize the outcomes of
violence	 in that it is unusual to see the victims suffering in a life-like
manner. In contrast	 live-action dramas airing during prime-time regularly
involve major acts of violence (e.g.	 rape and murder)	 and the pain and suffering
of the victim is often highlighted (Potter &amp; Warren	 1998).<br />
Although many violent cartoons meant for youthful consumption contain comedic
elements (e.g.	 Woody Woodpecker	 Scooby Doo)	 some of these cartoons just
portray the violence. For instance	 Samurai Jack	 X-Men Evolution	 and Batman:
The Animated Series depict animated violence	 with little to no comedic elements.
Moreover	 for these types of animated shows	 violence is found at the beginning
and end of disputes. Presence or absence of comedy during violence is an
important consideration when evaluating the effects of viewing cartoons on
youth	 for there is both theory and research to support the contention that
comedic elements may camouflage and trivialize depictions of violence (King	
2000; Potter &amp; Warren	 1998)</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;<b style=""color: rgb(51	 51	 51);""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Question:&nbsp;</span></b></p><p>Does
watching violent cartoon increase the aggression in children?</p>

<p><b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span>Hypothesis:<br />
</span></span></b>Children
who are exposed to violence through cartoon turn out to be more aggressive	
destructive and rebellious than the kids who are either less exposed or not
exposed at all.</p>

</span>Independent Variable : Cartoons</p>

<p><span>Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Dependant Variable: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(51	 51	 51);"">To conduct this experiment we will need

children will be required . They should be ranging from pre-schoolers to
elementary level .</span></p>

<p><span>The first group of kids (Group A) will
be made to watch a variety of cartoons like Batman	 Tom&amp;Jerry	 Superman	
Ben10 and similar cartoon for an hour or 2 everyday for 2 weeks .&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>Their actions and their way of facing

<p><span>During the same time the second group of
kids (Group B) will not be shown any cartoon	 they will be allowed to see
educational programs or animal documentaries instead of cartoons. <br />
Also similarly their actions and their way of facing and handling situations
will be seen and noted.</span></p><p><span><br />
We will be throwing in some of the following situations to get a more clear
result of our experiment	 to children from both&nbsp;

<p><span>3. Not give them a candy they really

<p>&nbsp;<b style=""color: rgb(51	 51	 51);""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">A
Similar Experiment conducted in a similar method:</span></b></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;Silvern and
Williamson (1987) conducted an interesting field</span><b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">
</span></b>experiment
involving cartoon violence and 28 preschool boys and girls. The experiment	
which took place over a three day period	 involved the assessment of baseline
aggression during dyadic play with a classmate	 the viewing of the humorously
violent cartoon Road Runner; and the playing of the now classic arcade game
Space Invaders	 which served as the violent video game. During the first day of
the experiment	 baseline aggression during dyadic play was assessed. During the
second day	 half of the children played the video game for six min and the
other half watched the 6 min long cartoon. Children were then observed in a
free-play session with the toys that were available during the base line
condition. During the third day	 youth who had watched the violent cartoon the
day before played the video game and youth who had played the video games watched
the violent cartoon. Once again	 a free-play session with the familiar<b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> </span></b>toys
took play. Prosocial behavior and fantasy play were assessed during each of the
three free-play sessions.<b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""></span></b></p>

<p>Additionally	 amount of peer-related physical and verbal
aggression	 and the frequency of object-oriented aggression were assessed. For
each individual	 the amount of aggressive	 fantasy	 and prosocial behavior was
compared between the baseline condition and the free-play session following
each of the two separate exposures to media violence.</p>

<p>Results indicated that	 relative to baseline levels of
responding	 after watching the comedically violent cartoon	 preschool youth
demonstrated higher rates of aggressive behavior and lower rates of prosocial
behavior. Unfortunately	 the breakdown of peer-oriented and object-oriented
aggression was not reported. Therefore	 it is impossible to determine if data
fit into the pattern mentioned above. It may be that	 consistent with previous
research	 peer related physical and verbal aggression were not affected by the
media violence exposure	 but that object-oriented aggression was. Moreover	
because there was no control group	 it is impossible to determine if aggressive
behavior would have increased and prosocial behavior would have decreased
during the second and third play sessions with familiar toys	 regardless of
whether they had been watching a violent cartoon or playing a violent video
game. It is possible	 for instance	 that frustration of playing with the same
child and the same toys over a period of days caused the aforementioned changes
in behavior. In addition fatigue effects cannot be completely ruled out; it is
possible that participants simply became less enthusiastic about the experiment	
resulting in greater levels of hostilities with their peer partner. In fact	
the reported reduction in prosocial behavior across sessions supports the
contention that fatigue was taking place: participants may have been getting
too fatigued to be prosocial.</p>

<p><b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Conclusion:</span></b></p>

<p>Children are exposed to violence in cartoons in a greater
frequency than in live-action dramas. Although adults consistently rate these
comedic cartoons as containing little violence	 the research on youth is
equivocal. Moreover	 although there are theoretical reasons to suggest that
comedic elements in cartoons trivialize or camouflage violence depicted within	
additional research on youth is necessary to discern whether developmental
status influences this process. Similarly	 factors that influence the
perception of violence in non-comedic cartoons	 such as graphicness and perceived
reality	 appear to be moderated by developmental processes. However	 there is
limited research in this area.</p>

<p>Across the early and middle childhood	 laboratory
experiments using cartoons with comedic violence have consistently failed to
demonstrate significant differences in person-oriented aggression. In contrast	
field experiments have consistently shown that aggressive behavior towards
peers increases following the viewing of non-comedic violent cartoons.
Similarly	 object-oriented aggressive behavior tends to increase following the
consumption of noncomedic	 violent cartoons. It may be that comedic elements in
cartoons camouflage animated violence	 thereby reducing the negative effects of
violent imagery on aggressive behavior. Although comedic violence appears to be
unrelated to aggressive behavior in youth	 additional research suggests that
this form of violence may increase aggressive thoughts and desires. However	 additional
research is necessary to see if such statements continue to work over a period
of weeks and months<b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">.</span></b></p>

"I am also very disappointed estimate. My research evaluated by only 14 points. I sent my research in a scientific journal in his Russian and published it. Consequently it did not deserve such a low rating. Very sad that keep all the items and even had settled U-Mann Whitney test for more accurate analysis.&nbsp;I think that these jobs are not competent to assess. Unfortunately	 I was disappointed :((((((<br /> "
Deadlines Calendar in iCal format has been provided. Check the Announcement page for it. Instructions are there for both Android and iPhone. I find it very useful and am happy about the facility. Thanks to Coursera and Pamela Fox.<br /> 
"Hello	 My name is NAME2590696	 I live in Madrid	Spain	 I Â´m a Psychologist and I am taking this course because I need to refresh many knowledges and I want to improve my english because my English is not good. Best regards. "
"If you can post your assignment in the new thread started by Caroline	 people can assess why it could have been a higher grade than 2! seriously	 I don't think anyone deserves a 2!! "
"Either the hypothesis be explicitly stated as a hypothesis; or without the label of hypothesis there be a statement that the design will prove something. If neither is there	 I think	 it does not attract any score. Anything defined as a conclusion can only be a conclusion and it may not be given the benefit of a hypothesis.<br />This is my opinion.<br /> "
"The problem summary:<br />This may sound little weird to all of those who are already evaluating the assignments of fellow classmates	 but the fact is my 'Peer Assessment' tab is empty. I haven't received any assignment of fellow classmate to evaluate. Is it possible? But coursera has mentioned that evaluating also matters in our own score. Somebody help me with this. I want to know where in my coursera homepage i can find the assignments to evaluate.<br />Steps to reproduce:<ol><li></li></ol><br />Screenshot:<br /><br /> "

"Oh&nbsp; thank you so much	 I figured later and I already finished quizz no. 1. I am litlle bit exited about everything this is for me a very big deal. Thank you<br /><br /><br /> "
"I got 10/10	 took me less than 10 min with twice check. <br />The quiz is very easy in my opinion. I expected a lot more complicated. "
"Thanks Charles	 I await the response to your question.<br /><br /> "
"The post-test says ""This assignment is graded. You will receive a score for your work."" That just means that it will tell you what you got wrong and what you got right	 not that it will actually affect your course grade	 right? "
Buna ziua tuturor! Ma bucur sa vad ca sunt si la noi persoane incantate de experienta Coursera...Dar...doar doamnele - domnisoarele or fi interesate de psihologie pe aici? :) Mult spor la studiu si ne mai â€vedemâ€ pe forum! 
I got a very low score on the first assignment and thought that i did well but i didn't include everything in words but thought i did a good job overall. &nbsp;Is there anyway to make up for my grade being so low? &nbsp;please email me direct at EMAIL15356 />STAFF do not reply to me here please.<br />thanks<br />amy

Hello Alex!<br />Once again my best compliments for the course! I am am not sure about the calculation and would really appreciate a re-calculation. Thanks a lot!<br />

"I got 22.5. For an assignment written in just 600 words	 I feel good about the score! "
"I would like to have my grade rechecked (88.9%). I have reasonable doubt that it was slightly lowered. I've received either 8s	 9s or 10s on all quizzes	 100% and 75% on our two assignments and 83% on the final exam. <br /> "
"What we could all do regardless of whether we feel we can manage this assignment or not	 is to be more elastic and resilient with our evaluations! That way we will acknowledge the difficulty of this task and give to our fellow students a chance to a descent grade. "
"I think the staff and team tried their best	 considering the number of students they need to accommodate this worked really well.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also feel there is a bit much negativity in the forums	 and without going into specific comments - I feel that deadlines are there to be stuck to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />If your boss needs the end-of-year-reports tomorrow night	 he expects them to be ready then.&nbsp; Sticking to deadlines is real life.&nbsp; Considering how serious people have taken this course	 I am surprised by some of the comments re. extended deadlines and changes to the points system. <br /> "
"I am quite confused with the question.<br /><br /><i>""NAME827212mething that is meant to increase the likelihood of a behavior 
occurring again by taking away something negative is called a 
_____________.""</i><br /><br />When you take away something negative to increase the likelihood of a behavior occurring again	 isn't that positive reinforcement also? Positive reinforcement does not only entail that you give reinforcement for a positive behavior but also	 it entails that you remove the aversive stimulus from the person to increase the likelihood that positive behavior will occur. However	 during negative reinforcement	 isn't it that you give something negative (what a person does not like) to decrease a negative behavior and increase compliance? I'm sorry but I am really in a rut about this question. If I am mistaken	 I will stand corrected but if I am not	 kindly do something about this. Thank you very much for the attention.<br /><br /> "
"I got 20. I'm happy	 I guess :-)<br /><br /> "
"Wow - love to see the worldwide participaton!  I'm from a small town in the Western United States.  Coursera is fantastic!  I am very grateful for the free education.  This particular course is just one of my topics of interest - not for career or degree.  
 "
"<p>Also it says that the study design should have all the essential components of a good scientific study. That includes data analysis and interpretation of results as two very important steps.. But if its just a proposed study design and we are not actually conducting the experiment	 the question of data analysis and interpretation of results doesn&#39;t occur at all... So how does this thing really work out...</p>
 "
"Here's the article:<br /><br /><div><p>TRONDHEIM	 Norway â€” In 1988	 two determined psychology 
students sat in the office of an internationally renowned neuroscientist in Oslo 
and explained to him why they had to study with him. </p></div>

<p>Unfortunately	 the researcher	 Per Oskar Andersen	 was 
hesitant	 May-Britt Moser said as she and her husband	 Edvard I. Moser	 now 
themselves <a href=""http://www.ntnu.no/cbm/moser"" target="""">internationally recognized 
neuroscientists</a>	 recalled the conversation recently. He was researching 
physiology and they were interested in the intersection of behavior and 
physiology. But	 she said	 they wouldnâ€™t take no for an answer. </p>
<p>â€œWe sat there for hours. He really couldnâ€™t get us out 
of his office	â€ Dr. May-Britt Moser said. </p>
<p>â€œBoth of us come from nonacademic families and 
nonacademic places	â€ Edvard said. â€œThe places where we grew up	 there was no one 
with any university education	 no one to ask. There was no recipe on how to do 
these things.â€ </p>
<p>â€œAnd how to act politely	â€ May-Britt interjected. </p>
<p>â€œIt was just a way to get to the point where we wanted 
to be. But seen now	 when I know the way people normally do it	â€ he said	 
smiling at the memory of his younger self	 â€œIâ€™m quite impressed.â€ </p>
<p>So	 apparently	 was Dr. Andersen. In the end	 he 
yielded to the Mosersâ€™ combination of furious curiosity and unwavering 
determination and took them on as graduate students. </p>
<p>They have impressed more than a few people since. In 
2005	 they and their colleagues reported the discovery of cells in ratsâ€™ brains 
that function as a kind of built-in navigation system that is at the very heart 
of how animals know where they are	 where they are going and where they have 
been. They called them grid cells. </p>
<p>â€œI admire their work tremendously	â€ said <a href=""http://neuroscience.columbia.edu/department/index.php?ID=27&amp;bio=97"" target="""">Eric 
Kandel</a>	 the Nobel laureate neuroscientist who heads the Kavli Institute for 
Brain Science at Columbia and who has followed the Mosersâ€™ careers since they 
were graduate students. </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.icn.ucl.ac.uk/Staff-Lists/MemberDetails.php?Title=Prof&amp;FirstName=John&amp;LastName=Okeefe"" target="""">John 
Oâ€™Keefe</a> of University College London	 who in the 1970s identified the 
so-called place cells in the brain that register specific places	 like the 
corner deli or grandmaâ€™s house	 and who was one of the Mosersâ€™ mentors	 said 
that the discovery of the grid cells was â€œincredibly significant.â€ </p>
<p>The workings of the grid cells show that in the brain 
â€œyou are constantly creating a map of the outside world	â€ said <a href=""http://www.rockefeller.edu/research/faculty/labheads/CoriBargmann/"" target="""">Cori 
Bargmann</a>	 of Rockefeller University	 who is one of the two leaders of a 
committee set up to plan the National Institutes of Healthâ€™s contribution to 
President Obamaâ€™s recently announced neuroscience initiative. </p>
<p>Often	 the workings of billions of neurons that 
produce our thoughts are opaque. But electrical recordings of signals emitted by 
grid cells show a map â€œwith a framework and coordinates that are completely 
intuitive	â€ Dr. Bargmann said. And to find such a straightforward system is	 in 
its own way	 â€œjust mind-boggling.â€ What is the brain doing being so mysteriously 
unmysterious? </p>
<p>The implications of the discovery are both practical 
and profound. The cells have been proved to exist in primates	 and scientists 
think they will be found in all mammals	 including humans. The area in the brain 
that contains the grid cell navigation system is often damaged early in <a href=""http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/alzheimers-disease/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier"" target="""">Alzheimerâ€™s 
disease</a>	 and one of the frequent early symptoms of Alzheimerâ€™s patients is 
that they get lost. The Mosers do not work on humans	 but any clues to 
understanding how memory and cognitive ability are lost are important. </p>
<p>On the most profound level	 Dr. Oâ€™Keefe	 the Mosers 
and others speculate that the way the brain records and remembers movement in 
space may be the basis of all memory. This idea resonates with the memory 
palaces of the Renaissance	 imagined buildings that used spatial cues as memory 
aids. The technique <a href=""http://www.mundi.net/cartography/Palace/"" target="""">dates to the ancient Greeks</a>. 
In this regard	 neuroscience may be catching up with intuition. </p>
<p><b>A Welcome Ambush</b> </p>
<p>Edvard	 51	 and May-Britt Moser	 50	 now direct the <a href=""http://www.ntnu.no/cbm/about"" target="""">Kavli Institute for Systems 
Neuroscience</a> and the Centre for the Biology of Memory at the Norwegian 
University of Science and Technology here in Trondheim. They have a steady 
stream of findings coming from their lab	 and a slew of awards	 the latest of 
which	 the <a href=""http://www.med.unc.edu/neuroscience/perl-prize"" target="""">Perl-U.N.C. Neuroscience 
Prize</a>	 they received April 16 at the University of North Carolina. </p>
<p>But they did not grow up in a center of academic 
ferment or intellectual competition. They were born and raised on islands off 
the coast of Norway a couple of hundred miles north of Bergen	 part of an area 
known as Norwayâ€™s Bible Belt. They went to the same high school	 but didnâ€™t 
really get to know each other until they met again at the University of Oslo in 
the 1980s. </p>
<p>May-Britt	 who grew up on a farm	 remembers an 
environment in which drinking	 card playing and dancing were all frowned upon. 
When she called home from Oslo announcing that she had been to a bar and had her 
first beer	 her mother said	 â€œAnd whatâ€™s next?â€ </p>
<p>The Mosers married in 1985 while still undergraduates. 
By the time they had finished their doctorates	 in 1995	 they had two daughters	 
but they were ready to see the world	 to train in laboratories outside Norway. 
And they did spend time in England	 with Dr. Oâ€™Keefe	 and in Scotland	 with <a href=""http://www.fens.org/people/past/morris.php"" target="""">Richard Morris</a> at the 
University of Edinburgh. </p>
<p>But the Mosersâ€™ travels were cut short when they were 
ambushed by a job offer too good to refuse	 from the university in Trondheim	 
where they have been ever since. </p>
<p>â€œWithout knowing it	 we actually negotiated	â€ 
May-Britt said	 â€œbecause we were not interested if we only got one job	 and we 
got two jobs. And we were not interested if we did not get the equipment we 
needed	 and they gave us that.â€ Suddenly	 without having really planned it	 they 
had their own lab. </p>
<p>Of course	 nothing happens suddenly in research. They 
began in what Dr. May-Britt Moser described as a bomb shelter	 and gradually	 
over time	 built up their program. Similarly	 they did not set out looking in 
the part of the brain where they ended up. </p>
<p>They began recording the activity of cells in the 
hippocampus	 with electrodes implanted in the brains of rats as they roamed an 
enclosed area. This is still a main method	 and the rats are intriguing to 
watch	 pursuing little bits of chocolate cereal on the floor of an enclosure	 
seemingly oblivious to the implants attached to their skulls. </p>
<p><b>A Black Box</b> </p>
<p>The Mosers wanted to find how information was flowing 
to the place cells	 whether it was going from one area of the hippocampus to 
another. But even after they inactivated sections of this brain area	 the place 
cells still functioned. So it seemed that information was flowing in from the 
nearby brain area	 the entorhinal cortex. </p>
<p>They started looking there	 and in their early work 
they were helped by <a href=""http://www.ntnu.no/cbm/witter"" target="""">Menno Witter</a>	 then in Amsterdam	 now at 
Trondheim	 in the delicate task of guiding the electrodes to the right spot. 
</p>
<p>â€œWe didnâ€™t immediately find the grid cells	â€ Dr. 
Edvard Moser said. At first they noticed cells that would emit a signal every 
time a rat went to a particular spot	 and they thought that perhaps this was 
something like the place cells in the hippocampus that are tied to locations in 
the outside world. But gradually they learned that what they were seeing was a 
cell that tracked the ratâ€™s movement in the same way	 no matter where the rat 
was. The cell was not responding to some external mark	 it was keeping track of 
how the rat moved. And when they gave the rats enough room	 a very regular 
pattern emerged. </p>
<p>â€œThe first thing was that we thought there was 
something wrong with the equipment	â€ Dr. Edvard Moser said. </p>
<p>â€œI thought	 â€˜Is this a bug?â€™&nbsp;â€ Dr. May-Britt Moser 
said. </p>
<p>After a 2005 paper in Nature	 in which they reported 
the discovery and named the cells	 other labs confirmed the findings and more 
discoveries followed	 in their lab and elsewhere. </p>
<p>It is now clear that the grid cells	 in combination 
with cells that sense head direction and others that sense borders or boundaries 
â€” both originally identified in other parts of the brain by other labs â€” form a 
kind of dead-reckoning navigation system in the brain that maps movement. </p>
<p>Information flows from this part of the brain to the 
hippocampus	 and then back. Exactly how the grid informs the place cells	 and 
vice versa	 is not known. </p>
<p>What scientists have now are two ends of a system with 
a black box in the middle that is not fully understood. At one end are place 
cells. At the other are grid cells. As to what exactly happens in between	 and 
how the grid cells form in the first place	 Dr. Edvard Moser said	 â€œThatâ€™s still 
a 10-	 a 20-year research problem.â€ </p>
<p>Or	 as Dr. Oâ€™Keefe put it	 â€œWe are still in the 
pre-Newtonian phase of neuroscience.â€ </p>
<p>The Mosers remain something of an anomaly. Not only 
are they off the beaten academic track	 but they are a married couple who work 
together on the same scientific problems at the same institution at the highest 
levels of science	 a true rarity. </p>
<p>They do have different spheres in their new	 
state-of-the-art lab. May-Britt is more hands-on with the experiments and the 
design	 and Edvard is more involved in mathematical analysis and interpretation 
of the results. </p>
<p>â€œWe have a common project and a common goal	â€ he wrote 
in response to an e-mailed question	 â€œand we both intensely burn for it. And we 
depend on each other for succeeding.â€ </p>
<p>He continued	 â€œMost couples manage to cooperate on 
child raising â€” for us	 our brain project is our third child	 so nothing 
different	 really.â€&nbsp;</p></div> "

"Gauthier	<br /><br />Your example sounds great. In cases of experimenting with natural happenings	 the question of randomizing and assigning does not obviously arise. My impression is that since Customers by definition are random there is no need to <i><b>assign(!)</b></i> someone to be a customer. Then	 the validity of the experiment may be lost. Similarly	 in natural happenings	 the question of rapport also does not arise. What counts is the choice of place and time.<br /><br />On the other hand	 in a controlled scenario	 randomization and assignment are compulsory in order to make a valid test. As we have learned	 there are 'single blind and double blind' experiments too. Either or both of the administrator and participants could be kept in dark about the study. It is still considered ethical. <br /><br />Thanks.<br /> "

"Hello from Vietnam.<br /><br />At the beginning of this course	 I was attending 4 or 5 courses in total	 not mention all the stuff at my university.

Anonymous I have to say I agree with you. I wish we had been assigned to do a quiz rather than write a paper. The reason being I'm really bad at writing papers. It was till I did my peer review of the other people's papers that I realized I did mine's all wrong. I didn't come even close to organizing it the way it should have been.

"Nancy my dear	 this mating dance is &nbsp;in the last stage	 you are ripe enough now to be mine.

Sorry if you can not get a 10 to save your life... but donÂ´t take it personally	 .high IQ aint a common asset.<br /><br /><br />PS	 well	 to be perfectly honest	 I am a bit pissed off 	 I expected a 10 yesterday	 but failed the question about social imitation during that test of following a light in a dark room....anyways	 a 9 aint bad at all.

"This is great news for many. However	 there are many of us who would have worked a bit harder just for one mark or just a few decimal points to make 90%. We know how agonizing it can be getting 89.9 or even 89% .&nbsp; I wish I had been told earlier. I agree with Anon above about the carrot of incentive. But anyway	 we knew the rules beforehand. Besides this is certainlt gracious of Dr Smith. <br /> "
your grade is not put onto the certificates. &nbsp;all that is on there is that you took it and completed it.

"Hi Welcome I am from Jamaica :)<br />I would say look at the&nbsp;quiz&nbsp;due dates and work your way around that	 the videos are short you can quickly watch those then reinforce what u see with the text and keep an eye on quiz deadlines you can still make. Week 2 quiz is open till April 19 starting there might help since u can still get a certificate if you only miss one quiz ( the lowest grade is thrown out) "
"The problem summary:<br />I can't access the OLI textbook. I was away last week and need to complete weeks 10 &amp; 11. When I click on the OLI Texbook tab	 I just get a LAUCH button	 which takes me to a screen informing me that the OLI is not fully configured (see screenshots below). Have never had a problem before.<br />Steps to reproduce:<ol><li>Click on the OLI Texbook tab in course menu	 at left of page.<br /></li></ol><br />Screenshots (2):<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""src"" />&nbsp; <img alt="""" src=""src"" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> "
"This is not one of the topics covered in the course material. It's just a short experiment I did with myself and a couple of friends months back.<br /><br />There might be studies on it but I haven't come across any. For a patient with anxiety disorder	 their minds are&nbsp;bombarded&nbsp;largely by anxiety throughout the day. Since I have OCD and I have a decent dream recall	 I paid close attention to my dreams and I noticed my OCD does not appear in my dreams. The closest I had come to was habits of OCD resurfacing in my dreams but not the actual anxiety.&nbsp;<br /><br />When we're dreaming	 our logical minds are not active. Which is why lucid dreamers use clocks/watches as one of their reality checks because the digits on the clocks/watches tend to appear as random digits or jumps abruptly.<br /><br />This might not be much of a finding but it helps me to narrow down the possible causes of anxiety disorders. If anxiety is only affecting the conscious mind	 there's a high possibility that willpower can overcome it or we can alter some information when we are subconscious or asleep.<br /><br />To add on	 I notice a lack of sleep reduces my anxiety too. This could hint that the logical mind is indeed controlling most of the anxiety.&nbsp; "
"Hello!<br /><br />l have always related letters&nbsp;in the alphabet with human characteristics. For example	 R&nbsp;is kind of and old man	 and grumpy too	 while S would be middle-aged woman	 very self-confident.<br />This doesn't happen with all the letters or at least l don't see relations as specific as these two with other letters	 even what l perceive may vary from time to time.<br />Could this be synesthesia?<br /><br />Also	 l sometimes think ""this tastes like the smell of cheese!"" or ""this smells like the taste of paella!"" but that's probably due to the close relation between the olfactory sense and the taste sense	 right?<br /><br />The guys&nbsp;in the video on the OLl textbook seemed to have more clear the synesthesic relations they perceive&nbsp;than me. Also l had a synesthesic classmate at high school who was able to relate people to full detailed&nbsp;images created&nbsp;in her mind	 for example l was an umbrella stuck up-side-down&nbsp;in a dune&nbsp;in the middle of the dessert. Also she specified&nbsp;if the umbrella was closed or open	 but l can't remember how&nbsp;it was. "
It does not say anywhere that the quizzes are open book tests. One does have to check the Honor Code button before submitting. That would suggest that they are not open book.&nbsp; 
"Sorry to bother	 but it was even better. I made 3 mistakes in the first 10 questions. My grade is well above 90%.... I love the (statistical) mean!<br /> "
maybe those who finished the course untimed will be wraped up into the course too. Thank you. Bye 
"I am reading that we can submit our assignment and resubmit it again. Does that mean that when I submit it I will get something that will give me an idea if I am doing this right?&nbsp; or	 does that mean you can keep changing it and the last one submitted before the deadline will be the one used for grading? <br /> "
how did you make it? for me the most difficult part of this course is that I have to read the book many hours from the screen - after some time I start to have problems with eyes and a headache - with OLI in this format I can print it and read from paper not from the monitor :)<br /> 
Since OLI is available 24x7 I utilize week ends to go through the text without waiting for the Video Lectures getting uploaded. NAME487897y the way we can save time.<br />

"Hi all	
Before starting the course you need to take a pretest quiz.. My score remained only 6 out of 20 .... I am a molecular biologist. Interested to know what was yours? "
Thank you Prof. Smith and all that made this a success. <br /> 
"When I tell my son to wash the dishes	 it's much more straitforward to explain his refusal or agreement by some behavioral (e.g. Reward or punishment) or cognitive mechanisms than by an innate instinct to wash or not to wash the dishes. 

When a schizophrenic person is shouting and running away from an imagined voices	 I would rather hear a straitforward neurological explanation. When Alzheimer's patient gets lost on the street	 I assume it does not happen because of the instinctive memory loss :-) Same thing for depressive behavioral symptoms	 OCD and etc. Of cause	 Freudian psychologists have something to say about it too	 but since drug treatment works much better	 biochemical explanation gets more support. 
 "
No reaction from the staff sofar. I suppose the software did not foresee my point and they have rewrite it.<br /> 
"Could anyone show us where does ""receptive field"" discuss in OLI Textbook or in Lecture Video?&nbsp; Thank you!<br /><br /><br /> "
"What I don't understand is the silence of the instructor and his TA's about that issue. I know that I did all what I was asked clearly; I cited all the steps of the experiment	 and I named them	 and yet I got only 18. What would be done about this injustice? "
"Just some clarifications:<br /><br />It's a good question.&nbsp; Hari B R	 that didn't exactly answer the question although in lieu of an answer- that would be a (onerous) solution.&nbsp; I too would like to know the answer to this question.&nbsp; Also- the link you provided gets me to a login screen.. one which I am unable to log in to.&nbsp; :(<br /><br />By saying 'can be accessed at any time' do you intend	 'yes	 once the course has ended you can access at least the OLI Text materials'?<br /><br />Thank you..<br /> "

"I think that ""logia"" as the second part of a composite word points to discourse. As in Psychologia: discussion about or concerning the psyche. "
"Apologies if this should be or is somewhere else.<br />Have noticed the odd typo and spelling misuse	 thought it might be useful to have a thread containing any that we notice for easy correction in the next issue.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm just going to start from where I am currently although I know there were a few before...<br /><br />pg 82 line 2: To - should read - two<br /><br /><br /> "
"I have always been interested in psychology. I am an attorney	 and I have been out of school for several years now. I am feeling the itch to learn more	 and I think this course will be a great way for me to learn something fun and interesting. &nbsp;I look forward to this class! "
"yes the same thing is happening to me	 so in the case what should we do? "
This crashed my computer. 
What about schizophrenia?can anyone explain cultural connection to it please?thanks 
"Rubina Rahiman and Portia Falcone	<br /><br />It is a pleasure discussing the subject and sharing knowledge among classmates distributed across the earth.<br />Thanks to the MOOC platform of Coursera	 it is amazing to learn more and more new perspectives emerging from all over.<br />My hope is that the Peer Assessment is going to open up an all new experience of great sharing among us.<br /><br />The main difference between Coursera and other social networks is that Coursera is fertilized in education. I am glad to get new friends from across continents with the convergence point being education.<br />Thanks :)<br /> "
My peers were at the bad mood also. 
"good day&nbsp;<br />i have a small problem when entering textbook oli perform activities i cannot see weel because the questionnaires are clippe	 i can do. "
Hello Norbert! Welcome to the Psychology course.&nbsp;<br />Looking forward to interacting with you.&nbsp;

"I wanted to get used to the OLI Textbook before the course starts	 but i couldn't load the page because of the untrusted certificate error. Here is the technical detailes i've got:

    psych.openlearninginitiative.org uses an invalid security certificate.
    
    The certificate is not trusted because no issuer chain was provided.
    
    (Error code: sec_error_unknown_issuer)

I'm using Mozilla Firefox 19.0.2 on Linux Mint 14	 and there is no option to add such a certificate to exceptions (usually	 there is such an option in Firefox).

![Here is the screenshot][1]

Everything seems to be working fine in Chromium; i can access OLI textbook now	 but i wonder whether i'm the only one who encountered such an error in Firefox?

I could not understand how our grades have been calculated. From the above mentioned methods my percentage is more than 70. but in my course records it shows 55% which means i do not get a certificate. Staff please clarify this.<br /><br /><br /><br />

"I  am reproducing below an extract from the Pedagogy page of Coursera.

 we have invested substantial effort in developing the technology of 
peer assessments	 where students can evaluate and provide feedback on 
each otherâ€™s work. This technology draws on two bodies of literature: 
First	 the education literature on peer assessments.  Following the 
literature on <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1662/0002-7685%ZIPCODE1%29063%5NAME4878970474:CPR%5D2.0.CO%3NAME4878972"">student peer reviews</a>	
 we have developed a process in which <i><b>students are first trained using a
 grading rubric</b></i> to grade other assessments.  This has been shown to 
result in accurate feedback to other students	 and also provide a 
valuable learning experience for the students doing the grading.  
Second	 we draw on ideas from the literature on <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1613751"">crowd-sourcing</a>	
 which studies how one can take many ratings (of varying degrees of 
reliability) and combine them to obtain a highly accurate score.  Using 
such algorithms	 we expect that by having multiple students grade each 
homework	 <i><b>we will be able to obtain grading accuracy comparable or even 
superior to that provided by a single teaching assistant. </b></i><br />:UNQUOTE<br /><br />It appears that the apprehensions of some of us are misplaced&nbsp; :))<br /> "
"I have completed several peer&nbsp;assessments	 and I&nbsp;have come to&nbsp;the conclusion&nbsp;that&nbsp;very few&nbsp;people had picked up on the instruction to ""follow the experimental method"".<br /><br />Where people followed the experimental method	 the rubric is very easy to follow when grading	 however for most of the experiments that I have reviewed	 people&nbsp;did not follow the clearly defined steps that we&nbsp;were taught&nbsp;in the first week	 and those&nbsp;papers have been&nbsp;very difficult to grade.<br /><br />The instructions for the assignment clearly mentioned having all of the components of a good&nbsp;experiment	 (as&nbsp;outlined in section 1.3 and 1.4).<br /><br /> If the rubric seems confusing	 simply go back to section 1.3 and 1.4 and it should make sense. The steps listed in this section are what we are looking for&nbsp;when grading papers.<br /><br />The experiments that followed this criteria are actually done correctly&nbsp;and were&nbsp;most likely not&nbsp;plagiarized	 they&nbsp;were simply done according to the outline in the lessons.<br /><br />I have seen some very well written experiments	 however&nbsp;the assignment objective&nbsp;to follow the ""experimental method"" was not met in many instances. It is not our responsibility to determine&nbsp;whether or not&nbsp;a paper is well written	 but to look for specific elements that were supposed to be included	 as outlined in the rubric.<br /><br />I hope my perspective helps clarify&nbsp;some of the confusion that I have seen in other posts.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> "
"Nope	 got a 0 for the 'cultural differences'' part	 which brought my grade down a lot. "
do both the assignment will be equally weighted in 40%... or sum of two will be considered... <br />1st assignment has higher total marks and if the sum of two will be considered then 1st assignment will get higher weight-age in the 40% grades... <br />anybody from staff plzzz clarify this ..&nbsp; <br /> 
"<p>Hi mani... We&#39;re all new to this course here.. Well most of us atleast.. Don&#39;t worry and start from the very beginning.. It&#39;s interesting and very intriguing..

"Just let us know when something is not clear	 we will try to explain. Some terms are really difficult if it is not your field so that problem should be encountered by many. Together	 we will make it work. "
I agree with you Dr. Sood.&nbsp;<br /><br />Other courses encouraged generosity in grading and I am going to apply it here. 
"I think that there are an error	 because there are 2 solutions corrects	 in fact both are correct. Please staff checke it please	 before deadline submission. "
mine too please!<br /><br /> 
"I too keep notes on everything important	 and also because of that I needed the triple time to complete each unit... Maybe I should take the exam today	 while everything still makes sense : ) Who knows? Maybe unconsciously I'll know the answers! "

"I guess I am going to study the OLI textbook first	 up to now I have been doing the lectures then the OLI area that is the same then going back and doing the next lecture and so on. Who knows might actually work out better for me.&nbsp; Good time to try an alternate way of studying! <br /> "
"I was very glad to see that Professor Smith has put his lectures on the website in advance. I started to listen to him eagerly	 and I want to share with you my two cents. 

Firstly	 I am happy that we have a charismatic lecturer	 who speaks clearly and gets straight to the point. But that's the problem: he gets too straight to the point. I assume that most of Couserians are as familiar with the subject as I do	 - after all we have chosen what we like. Basics are important	 but what's more important are personal thoughts and criticism. 

I have watched on YouTube lectures in ""introdution to psychology"" by John Gabrieli from MIT and YouTube lectures in ""introdution to psychology"" by Paul Bloom from Yale. They are open and free. 
Both Professor Bloom and Professor Gabrieli gave the same basic material	 but John Gabrieli gave a more neurological view on psychology	 while Paul Bloom gave a developmental view. It was wonderful! Paul Bloom also invited famous guest lecturers (e.g.	 Peter Salovey) to speak about their studies. 

I have expected something similar here. I would love Professor Smith to talk about the subject from a cognitive view maybe with inclusion of life-long development. If we don't know something we can catch it on wikipedia	 but what's most important is not to be bored.

What I see now is a very clear bases (that both Gabrieli and Bloom shared in common) but without any personal addition. Suppose I did not know the basics	 I could read it from Gerrig and Zimbardo's website and it would have been much faster. It's not the reason why I came to this course. 

To be more clear about what I mean by ""personal addition"" I want to give an example. I am taking now Coursera Course ""know thyself"". Lecture N4. Freud. The way Mitchel Green talks about Freud is very personal and interesting.  I am sure that Professor Smith can give amazing lectures. That's why I am writing what I write and that's why I stay and not sign out. But I would love to see some changes in that directions. 

Best wishes and have a wonderful learning experience. "
Thank You...

"Question1: have other people seen the criteria for evaluation while preparing their assessment?<br />I somehow missed them. I know we were supposed to use ""what we know about the scientific method""	 but without an example or clear criteria	 and with the instructions available	 I know I have missed some points (like mention of the analysis or number of participants in the overall experiment). In general	 I would suggest that criteria for evaluation are displayed while you write the assignment (Bob Mager teaches).<br /><br />Question2: I am currently evaluating a submission	 and I see that it already contains some details from an analysis. It seems very detailed but it also seems like copied from somewhere else. I doubt that somebody able to prepare such a detailed experiment would follow an online course. So	 according to the available criteria it's all perfect. However	 I start believing I am evaluating an existing article describing the method used for an experiment. Not sure how to handle.&nbsp;<br /><br />Question3: In fact as I am evaluating	 somebody has described an experiment and mixed up independent and dependent variables	 but there is no criteria for incorrect definition. Not sure how I should handle.&nbsp;<br /><br />It's all fine for this submission	 I would maybe suggest for the next one to have:<br />1. criteria for evaluation provided BEFORE the assignment<br />2. some instructions on how to handle potential plagiarism (not being experts we are not real good peer reviewers)<br />3. include criteria for incorrect definition of variables and to distinguish between good and weak definition of research hypothesis&nbsp; "

"I know nothing about peer assessment on this course. When I click on Peer assessment all that comes up is' System Error. This page is not available'. Can a member of staff please enlighten all of us as to what peer assessment is and how it works on this course	 whether it is optional and the % of marks	 if any	 allocated to it. Personally I do not think that any of us	 like myself	 who are novices on an introductory course on a scientific subject like psychology is capable of peer assessment and I believe that if	 as has been reported on this forum that 40% of final mark goes on peer assessment	 that then results could be very skewed which would be a pity.

"I disagree as a retired University lecturer in Statistics	 I believe the correct answer should be 34%	 68%	 95%. 68% is technically one standard deviation below the mean and one standard deviation above the mean which in fact is 2 standard deviations.&nbsp;<br />The answer that has been marked as the correct response is in fact 2	 4 and 6 standard deviations not 1	 2 and 3.<br />Regards<br />NAME841479 "
"The guidelines&nbsp;from the rubric actually came from the lesson on the experimental method that we learned early on in the course. We were supposed to follow that procedure which has clearly defined steps that the rubric is looking for. You may not&nbsp; want to hear this but technically&nbsp;we had the rubric prior to the assignment	 this is what I followed:<br /><br /> ""In the following activity	 you learn about a model presenting a five-step process of               scientific research in psychology. A researcher or a small group of researchers               formulate a research question and state a hypothesis	 conduct a study designed to               answer the question	 analyze the resulting data	 draw conclusions about the answer to               the question	 and then publish the results so that they become part of the research               literature found in scientific               journals.""

"I don't think that it is fair	 that someone gets good marks just for copying while others really spend hours to think about this topic and to write their own sentences.

It really confused me while reading	 because there was no connection	 no bridge between the copied paragraphs.

"Indeed Phoebe	 to improve the outcome of Peer Grading	 we can:<br />1. take into account that there were no published criteria or training offered on how to grade	 neither an option to grade yourself (which are all possible in coursera <a href=""http://help.coursera.org/customer/portal/articles/ZIPCODE5-how-do-peer-assessments-work-"">http://help.coursera.org/customer/portal/articles/ZIPCODE5-how-do-peer-assessments-work-</a>)<br />2. evaluate as many peer assignments as possible	 to have a better average outcome and to have a better feeling for the average when you grade<br />3. not go hard on evaluation of criteria that were not made obvious before the assignment <br /><br /> "
"<p>Is it some kind of sophisticated mockery? :)  </p>
<p>Why there even were Alex's clarifications? Why	 why	 why?<br /></p>
<p>Cultural differences? It's another separate HUGE QUESTION of psychology along the ""nature-nurture"" problem	 ""body-mind"" etc.<br />Why exactly they were chosen to be evaluated? Why not	 say	 mentioning of <i>sensitive periods</i> which directly concern the interaction of nature and nurture? [I did mention neither :D]</p><p>The way assignments are presented should be modified. It doesn't work for MOOC. And the course itself is good! I love it! [For instance	 I couldn't stand the ""Cognitive Cannibals"". :D]<br /></p> "
"Instead of posting again and yelling at the people you could just start reading. On the peer assessments page you can read	 that there is a deadline for the submission of the first assignment and that the deadline is already over. So: No	 you can't take this assignment.<br />For a successfull finishing of the course you need 70% of the points of 10 quizzes	 two assignments and the final test. Since you missed the first 6 quizzes and the first assignment you have no chance to get a certificate (since from this point you can get only 65% if you finish every task with 100%). You can find these information on the syllabus-page.<br /> "
I agree with Steven. &nbsp;I plan to use the rubrics loosely and mark generously.

"John	<br /><br />You are correct. Standard Deviation is arrived as follows.<br /><br />Square all the deviations (Score minus Mean) around the mean in order to get rid of any negative signs.

"<p>During the entire duration of the action potential 	 the Na+ channels/ gates that had initially opened to cause the depolarisation remain inactivated	 thus preventing the initiation of a second action potential.. This is called absolute refractory period and lasts normally for a millisecond.. This is the period when the neuron is completely depolarised. It is followed by a relative refractory period when the neuron  enters the stage of repolarization due to opening of K+ channels. It is possible to attain an action potential in this stage but the stimuli will have to be much higher than the  initial threshold value... This might last upto several milliseconds...</p>

Skimming through definitions	 abstracts and conclusions I created my own idea on the topic	 <b>while saving the references I found more informative along with the sentences that brought that information	 and cross-referencing it with the use of numbers [1] ...&nbsp;</b>(this saved some time later)<br /><br />2. <b>Structure:</b> I used the structure of a 5 point essay (introduction	 body	 conclusion	 with the body containing 3 subtopics)<br />Introduction (what the essay is about	 nature versus nurture and how it is studied	 some background about schizophrenia)<br />Body (genetic factors	 environmental factors	 research)<br />Conclusion: just one sentence with what I deduced from the above<br />Resources: here I copied my references with reference numbers [1] reference title link to page<br /><br />3. <b>Essay</b>: I copied the referenced sentences I had saved before into the body of&nbsp;my structure (some definitions in the introduction)	 and wrote my essay around them	 using those referenced sentences and rewriting them to ensure readability	 always making sure that the reference was maintained when I stated something I found somewhere. I made sure the conclusion was of course consequent with what was written in the body ;-)<br /><br />4. <b>Check</b>: I went back a few times to read it again and made some adjustment	 and I believe I'll do it again before the deadline<br /><br />5. One more hint: there is another ongoing course on psychology on coursera	 and the first two lectures of current week 4 handle the topic of nature versus nurture	 so they may provide some idea&nbsp;<a href=""https://class.coursera.org/intropsych-001/lecture/index"" title=""Link: https://class.coursera.org/intropsych-001/lecture/index"">https://class.coursera.org/intropsych-001/lecture/index</a><br /><br />Well	 I am sure there are plenty of better strategies around	 but at least this worked for me	 and it went pretty fast (but remember to save your best references and cross-reference the&nbsp;quotes from them as you do your research).&nbsp; "

"I got a score of 23 and thought I'd share my assignment	 if it helps anyone get an idea of what they missed. While it is true that peer assessments do involve a bit of luck	 I would much appreciate if anyone has feedback for me on anything I might've missed out on. Here:<br /><br /><p>As a practicing handwriting analyst	 my research interests
lie in exploring a possible relationship between handwriting and diseases.
While much research has been gone into relationship of a personâ€™s handwriting
to his/her personality	 its links to diseases are relatively unknown. Through
this research I would like to identify handwriting traits that would help predict
onset or detect early stages of a disease. For this experiment	 I have chosen
to study the letters <i>g	 j</i> and <i>y</i> and their link to a pre-existing diabetic
condition. The reason for choosing these specific letters is that each of them
has a lower loop area (or just a line instead of the full loop in some peopleâ€™s
handwriting) which is indicative of physical strength. A person who is
physically fit will usually emphasize the lower loop and it will be darker (because
of the varying pressure we use while writing) in the handwriting	 a person who
is not physically fit will usually write this lower area in a very light shade.
I want to study if the same can also be applied to indicate a pre-existing
diabetic condition.</p>

<p>RESEARCH QUESTION â€“ Can specific handwriting traits indicate
a diabetic condition?</p>

<p>HYPOTHESIS â€“ PEOPLE WITH DIABETES WILL HAVE DARKER LOWER
LOOPS IN THEIR HANDWRITING</p>

<p>OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS â€“ Diabetic condition here is defined
here as people who have a <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">diagnosed</span> blood sugar level more than the
normal range. </p>

<p>Dark loops here are defined as an average of 60 or more
occurrences of dark lower loops in letters g	 j and y in a personâ€™s handwriting
sample. [People will usually write with a mix of both dark and light loops but
one of these types occurs significantly more times than the other in a personâ€™s
writing. An occurrence of 60 or more (out of the 100) â€˜darkâ€™ loops will lead to
a person being categorized as a darker lower loops writer and 60 or more
â€˜lightâ€™ loops will lead to a person being categorized as light lower loops
writer. There is no specific measure for the shade in handwriting analysis but
we usually look for pressure on the next page. If thereâ€™s any impression on the
next page	 the loop would be dark	 in absence of any impression on the next
page	 it is light. A trained analyst can judge the shade intuitively	 over time	
by just looking at the sample.]</p>

<p>INDEPENDENT VARIABLE â€“ The independent variable in this
experiment is diabetic condition as the hypothesis is to study whether this
diabetic condition will influence how people will write certain letters.</p>

<p>DEPENDENT VARIABLE â€“ The shade (dark or light) of lower
loops in letters g	 j and y is the dependent variable as it is hypothesized to
change in connection with whether or not a person is diagnosed with a diabetic
condition.</p>

<p>METHOD - I will use a <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">quasi-experimental design</span> for
this experiment since a pre-existing diabetic condition is a pre-requisite for
a part of the study. There will be 100 participants	 divided into two groups of
50 each â€“ 1) People with a diagnosed diabetes condition and 2) People with no
diabetes (<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Control Group</span>). The participants will be asked to write a
specific article	 chosen carefully to ensure that it has 100 occurrences of the
letters g	 j and y combined. They will be asked to submit written samples on
A4-size blank sheets (ruled sheets can influence peopleâ€™s natural writing).
This same procedure will be repeated at intervals of two weeks	 two months and
then two years (while mood influences writing to a certain extent	 basic traits
in a personâ€™s handwriting remain constant over lifetime). The samples will be
studied for the dominant shade of the lower loops in a personâ€™s handwriting to
qualify them as dark or light writers. They will then be compared against the
presence or absence of a diabetic condition. Data from this will be studied to
see if the diabetic group has a significantly higher number of people who write
with dark lower loops as compared to the control group.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - - -&nbsp;</p> "
Hello Alex!<br />At first I'd like to thank you for the excellent course and your caring for us students. Nevertheless there is a little prob with my first assignment. I have deigned an experiment and wrote a research hypothesis and that as well as how the collected data was to be analyzed. In both cases I only got 3 points from the peers and don't think that is correct. From my point of view it schould be at least 4 points in both cases. <br />Please have a look at it. I would be happy to be sure about that aspect.<br />Greets from Germany!<br />JÃ¼rgen<br /> 
"I graded a paper that switched dependent and independent variables. Also	 it was a quasi-experiment. I really don't know if I graded the person's work well. I wish we had a rubric for comments so I could point out to person about this mistake. It really is a big mistake	 one should really distinguish between independent and dependent variables. On the other hand	 I didn't mark the person down for creating a quasi-experiment	 the instructions were vague and people did the best they could.<br /> "
"I had more of a problem with Question 32	 thought the correct answer for that one was very ambiguous. Was looking for something like ""Overestimate dispositonal attribution"". Wasn't there	 so chose the closest one to it	 or so I thought. Ah well	 good course all the same. "
"I got deducted 20% because ""You didn't complete the peer assessments."" <br />However	 I did do all three assessments. I don't think I missed anything. If I did please let me know what I missed. All I saw was the rubic. I didn't see any other part. I don't want to miss anything for the second assignment. "
"I'm having problems with the rubric too. I posted a request for&nbsp;a rubric&nbsp;shortly after the assignment was given. No rubric was posted and there was&nbsp;no response to my request.<br /><br />Not having a comment box is really bad because I want to explain why I chose&nbsp;the scores that I gave.<br /><br />And one rubric in particular just makes little sense. This was for the dependant variable:<br /><br /><b>The student should explicitly identify and describe the dependent variable	 including an operational definition (how the student defines the dependent variable).</b><br /><br />(5) The hypothetical construct is the object of study	 and
behavior is being measured.Variable identific ...[What if this is true	 but no dependent variable is&nbsp;defined?]

<br /><br />(3) The dependent variable is defined and behavior is being
measured.

<br /><br />(2) Behavior is being measured.

[This has nothing to do with the stated criteria]<br /><br />(0) There is no measurement of behavior 

[Again	 this has nothing to do with the stated criteriasa. What if this is true but the dependent variable is defined?]<br /><br />I used this one as an example. There are problems with others as well. Since the rubric can't be changed in mid-stream	 I am choosing to be as generous as I can with the caveat that I should have a reasonable explanation&nbsp;of why I chose that score (not that I'll ever have a chance to tell anyone - but for my own peace of mind).<br /><br />Sign me Frustrated<br /> "

"Well	 I guess I just put in my 2 cents since I'm one of those ""disabled"" students. I have bipolar disorder and have lived with social anxieties my whole life. I just completed a Coursera course called the Social Context of Mental Health and Illness. This course consisted of a bunch of video lectures and quizzes as well as 3 written peer assessments	 2 small ones and the Final assignment. Talk about pressure!! I went through a whole repertoire of feelings and symptoms but managed to get all my assignments in on time. I sure am proud of myself that I did because I ended up getting 98.1%	 entitling me to a Statement of Accomplishment with&nbsp;<b>Distinction</b>!! :-) So I guess us ""disabled"" peeps can do this too if we put some effort into it! &nbsp; <br /><br />I can't stand the word ""disabled""	 I have a disorder	 I'm not
 ""disabled"". When I find that life isn't accommodating me	 (and it can't
 accommodate everyone all the time you have to realize that by now	 
you're old enough) I find some different way around it. But not 
everything is meant for me	 some things are out of my grasp. You know 
what I do when that happens? I find a way to deal with it or I move on	 
because that's life. You can't expect everyone to do things the way you 
want it. Slapping down the law will not get you results or support	 it'll make you look weak! Toughen up	 honey	 ask nicely for some help and we'll help you get through the peer assessments	 but whine and complain and I think you'll find yourself quite lost!<br /> "
"I agree that the correct answer should round to the nearest whole percentage -- i.e.	 100%. &nbsp;I wasn't going to divulge the answer until the exam closes later today	 but it seems the cats out of the proverbial bag. &nbsp;See also my similar	 older post under ""Assignments"". "

"Hi Stephanie	&nbsp;<br /><br />I believe the only way of knowing your scores right now is to look and calculate them individually.&nbsp;<br />If you click on Quizzes (left hand side) you will see all your scores. Add them all up	 and divide that number by the number of quizzes you have taken (not counting the pre-test). ie: <br />Quiz 1: 7/10<br />Quiz 2: 8/10<br />Quiz 3: 6/10<br />Quiz 4: 10/10<br />Quiz 5: 9/10<br />= 40	 divided by 5 (number of quizzes for this example) = 8	 so you would have an average of 8/10 for your quizzes.<br />Quizzes are worth 30% of your mark	 so you would have an average of 24/30 (8 x 30 / 10 x 100) (or your average score&nbsp;x 30 / 10 x 100)<br /><br />For you assessment	 it is out of 23. So your grade divided by 23 x 100. ie	 if you got 18	 you would do 18/23 x 100 = 78%<br />The assessments are averaged out and are worth 40%. If you keep that average of 78% for the next assessment	 you would have 78 x 40 / 100 = 31/40% (you could also do 18 x 40 / 23 = 31%)<br /><br />This will give you an average score. For the quizzes and assessment average	 you would have (24 + 31 = 55/70	 or 78	5% average. But of course	 the second assessment nor the quiz have been taken into account.&nbsp;<br /><br />Do not hesitate if you have any more questions	 or let me know if this hasn't answered your questions...

Thank you Leanne for your very useful comments. I was beginning to get worried reading all the others. Let's hope we get proper notification and direction on this highly suspect part of the course. I think that 40% is far too high for peer assessment and will lead to skewed final results and am apprehensive about this part of the course especially because this is a technical study of a scientific subject and the vast majority of us students are mere novices.&nbsp;<br /><br />

Alex said that everyone has been given credit for question 7 on Quiz 10. Why has my score not changed. My answer is still marked wrong. Should I see a change. or is there a different way to give the mark??? Do other students have this concern?<br /> 
Could someone explain the difference better. The material does not speak clearly about the Beta effect.<br /> 
"I'm trying not give anything away	 but on Quiz 7	 question 9	 ""Which statement is <b><i>false</i></b>?""I looked at the correct answer for the question	 and it seems to be a contradiction of something Anderson Smith said in lecture video 7:3.&nbsp;<br />Was this a mistake? Did whoever wrote the quiz accidentally make the correct answer a true option	 rather than the false answer? (If that makes sense)<br />I'd like to be more specific	 but I don't want to give anything away	 and if there was a mistake	 I'd hope I can help get it fixed before everyone's finished with the quiz. "
And to finish I think you're post is totally inappropriate and just insulting toward the entire principle of Coursera and toward the people who designed this course. You can speak up your mind while being polite and considerate. This basically just a rant. Nothing constructive in it. 
"Well	 if you click it	 you get:<br /><div><div><div><h4>Report a problem with:&nbsp;Peer Assessment</h4><h5>Flag as a violation of policy or code of conduct?</h5>Bullying or abuse<br />Honor Code violation<br />Spam<br />Mature or inappropriate content<br />Different conduct violation<h5>Flag as a student health concern?</h5>Student indicates intent to harm themself or others<br />Student indicates that they are a victim of violence or abuse<br />Other student health concern</div><div></div></div></div><div><span>Create report<br /><br />Maybe this might be the appropriate way to handle suspected Honour Code violations	 rather than threatening to score people 0?</span></div> "
"Why are some people averaging the peer assignments? I believe Alex said each assignment was worth 20% individually. Also	 averaging reduces the overall mark for the peer assignments. Check it on your own marks.<br /> "
"I read that too	 thanks<br /> "
Hopefully I calculated wrongly cause with me doing it I failed cause I got a 62.26 cause of my first paper. &nbsp;I hate this. &nbsp;Well if this is the case at least I learned what I did. &nbsp;I won't be retaking it cause I only took it for the learning experience. &nbsp;I already have a Bachelors in Marketing and 2 Masters (MBA and Masters in Project Management). &nbsp;I also am in 10 other classes now so trying to do my best while working full time and being in the hospital last two days and going back and having surgery May 3rd and having another one coming up. &nbsp;<br />Well wanted to say thanks to everyone for a great class and learning from everyone. &nbsp;I loved the teacher and thought he was great at teaching us everything.<br /><br />Thanks again to everyone. 
Great job and appreciate it!<br />

"As far as I have understood	 reinforcement (either positive or negative) is used to encourage a behaviour occuring again.<br />Negative reinforcement is by taking away such as an unpleasant situation where as positive by adding something pleasant.<br />For example <br />Negative reinforcement: if you have done well at a test	 your parents may tell you that you won't have to do the laundry for this week (assuming that you do not want to do the laundry) in order to encourage you to do well to other tests as well.<br />Positive reinforcement in the same example could be:  if you have done well at a test	 your parents may tell you that you can have a party at your house	 or stay out late	 etc. Again to reinforce your behavior (studying).<br /> "

"Dear fellow students	 i can really understand that when you have put in a lot of work and effort it feels frustrating that some people take aneasy ride with copying and pasting. But instead of&nbsp;putting energy&nbsp;in the fact that people waiste an opportunity to really profit from a good course and the chance to educate and develop themselves please don't let their decission take away the reward you get out of all your work. This energy can be used to treasure and appreciate yourself for taking the opportunity	 applying yourself	 be proud of that. You have worked hard and you will benefit from that. Also out of respect for the people who have put in a terrific effort to develop and offer us this course with a lot of room to practice	 a lot of online resources and the opportunity to get feedback on our effort. I really do understand the frustration. So i would like to say to all who have put in the effort	 be proud of that. These discussion platforms are a good way of exchanging and deepening knowledge and supporting fellow students. A beautifull evening to all of you and good luck on the last part of the course! "
"You did excellent work and put in a lot of effort	 i can understand you are upset and to me that is a perfectly normal reaction. Despite the discussion i can see from your paper you have obviously done your best and taken a lot of time and effort and i'm sorry you weren't graded accordingly. "

"I agree with Hari B R. The student who wrote the assignment in a language other than English should've ''put'' the assignment through the translator.

peer assessments is actual asses the brain quality. 
"Helcio	<br /> First I want to say that I thought your&nbsp;experiment was well written. You had your question	 you described your experiment clearly and in detail and you mentioned anylizing your data. However some of the components of the experimental method were missing.<br /><br />What was not clear to me was the ""Hypothisis"" where you should have clearly discribed what you thought the outcome was going to be and why. I think it was there somehwere in the background	 but it was supposed to be clearly defined as a particular step.<br /><br />Your test groups were a bit vague in the sense that they were not cleraly defined groups of&nbsp;people who would participate throughout the experiment. Just saying&nbsp;""Customers"" is too vague and being that customers vary from day to day the test could be confounded. <br /><br />Had you chosen 40 customers to follow under normal conditions and compared those to another 40 customers who would shop when music was introduced	 you could measure any possible changes in behaviors in those people shopping with music to the control group who were not exposed to the music.<br /><br />I included everything that&nbsp;the rubric was looking for (as I described in previous posts)	 and I still did not do as well as I expected.&nbsp;I think there was just too much confusion. I passed but barely.<br /><br />How bad was it for you? "
"I did not explicitly write<b> Independent	Dependent variables</b> and also
I did not specify <b>Hypothesis.</b>But I was &nbsp;clear in what I had written.Looks like grades were given only to people who did mention these .!!<br /><b></b>Hope we are clearer as to what we need to write and specify and the guidelines are even more clearer for &nbsp;our second assignment.<br /><br /> "

"<p>Thank you for sharing. Very interesting thoughts. I think that Freud would have agreed with you :-)</p>

"Folks	 I totally agree with all of you. I hope there's another part to the course. My favorite thing about the course is the OLI textbook. I usually fall asleep when trying to read my textbooks for classes but this one was able to keep me fully engaged. Also am I mistaken or did Dr Anderson write the textbook? "
"So	 I am curious... Has anyone actually taken the FINAL EXAM?!

"You would be correct- some people do not dream	 although from all that is known	 all people with normal healthy brains dream.  First of all	 I encountered some case information concerning brain injury keeping people from dreaming in some documentary I watched on netflix on dreaming - I can't remember the name of it.  Secondly- as one might imagine- some people who have very little beyond a brain stem presumably can't dream among a great many other things they can't do.  This is important to think about.  Realize to some extent that there is a style to question writing and I think we have picked up on one here- and I have noticed it in other questions in the pretest- the questions are not super-precise.  I immediately found this question unanswerable upon reading it- but then tried to realize what the question might be trying to get at- which is really - the veracity of the common claim some (normal-brained) individuals make - that they do not dream.  In fact they do.  That is the question you are really answering.  It would take a paragraph or two to ask it precisely so the question is abbreviated.  You get the clue about the references of the question in the way he addresses it in the video. "
"<p>I am not supposed to

suppose	 as that particular factor does not find a mention neither in OLI nor

"I am frustrated by the marking rubric requiring <b>explicit</b> statement of the variables. One would not usually explicitly state your variables in a research project - stating the purpose of the experiment	 the&nbsp; hypothesis and the method would normally implicitly state the variables without offending your readers' intelligence by explicitly stating them. <br /><br />Had I know before submission that 10 marks would be allocated to this	 I would have stated them explicitly. Now I feel as though a piece of work in which I invested a significant amount of time may prove virtually worthless.<br /><br />These assignments need to clearly define the expectations before submission - provide the rubric against which they will be evaulated. It is not helpful to find out after the fact that you did not meet expectations of which you were totally unaware.<br /><br />I was also disappointed by the lack of opportunity to provide feedback to the people whose assignments I evaluated. While I marked to the rubric and all of them scored well	 there were some fundamental flaws in some of their research designs about which it may have been useful to provide some feedback.<br /><br /><br /> "
"I am very sorry to hear it	 I also feel the same. I am lucky I do not have the signature track	 because I strongly agree this whole course is of a poor quality	 although the textbook is amazing. I had no time to keep up with all this and gave up 4 weeks ago. I was participating in 8 courses to date and never raised a question about the teaching techniques	 but this time I really see no point even following the lectures. I really feel bad saying so	 but it is true. There is another psychology course I am following at the moment and it is really great. I am happy there are more courses on this subject	 because it was something I wanted to study for a long time:) &nbsp; "

Hello. We are about in the middle of the course and I want to share my feelings about it on this busy forum.

"Hi everyone	<br />I too&nbsp;found this&nbsp;question to be ambiguous..<br />According to the OLI textbook creative intelligence is ""the ability to adapt to new situations and create new ideas or         practicality (e.g.	 the ability to write good memos or to effectively delegate         responsibility)"". So I thought the correct answer would be creative intelligence. <br />I would appreciate it if Dr.Smith or Alex could clarify this issue. Thank you. "

"Notice: that the final exam contains 35 questions instead of 30 (as announced). Further the first 10 of these questions are to be considered to be a last quiz and not the final exam.<br />So	 it would be fair to assign 28.6% of the 5 points lost due to late submission to the quizzes score and hence NOT to your final exam. In other words. Your score for your final exam should therefore be: 0.8571 x 25/25 x 10 x 0.3 = 2.57.<br />If you had perfect scores for your quizzes (1-11) plus assignments	 your final result would be:<br />(110 + (10 x 0.8571))/12 x 0.3&nbsp; = 2.96<br />(1 +1)/2 x 10 x 0.4 = 4<br />final 2.57<br />Grand total: 9.53. That is with distinction.<br />However	 since you wrote that you will not pass with distinction I assume that you did not have perfect scores for the quizzes or the assignments. Your only hope is that the staff will attribute part of the degradation due to too late submission to the quizzes. There the degradation can better level out over the other 11 grades and may	 finally	 get you still a score of 90% or more. I wish you luck.<br /><br />BTW: I have also a discussion	 since my grand total score is 8.99 and that is less than 90% (if the staff will not round up to 90% flat). If	 however	 I attribute the first 10 questions of the final exam to the quizzes I score above 90%. Since the staff announced that the first 10 questions of the final exam are to be considered the last quizz I have the opinion that this should be the case. I don't know if the staff reads these forum submissions	 but if that is not the case	 I feel obliged to lodge a complaint. Good luck.<br /> "
"I have been a big fan of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) since I was first tested in the early 1980s. It&nbsp; changed my life when I learned	 through this test	 how other people are different	 not wrong. I became qualified to give the test	 but my emphasis was always on learning why people act like they do and how to find common ground even with those who are your complete opposites.<br />In my experience	 the biggest problem was that people tended to answer the questions in a way that they would like to be rather than what they are. Some answered what they thought their friend would answer	 etc. Those who were completely honest were able to learn a lot about themselves and how they related to the people around them.<br />I know the MBTI has been criticized a lot	 but I am very grateful for the influence it has had on my life.<br />INFJ "
"Dear Pedro	<br />&nbsp;There was and to a small extent there is	 relation between culture and heritability. NAME487897ut it is not prevalent the world over. It may not be seen in your place.<br /><br />Until a couple of centuries ago	 Indians were strictly following a system in which hereditary occupation was the norm. Relatives in the same clan would object if a member wished to take up a different profession. In that system	 heritability accounted for the particular type of intelligence required to profess the occupation decided by birth. Any amount of nurture could not compensate&nbsp; and equal the heritable intelligence.<br /> "

"Hello	 I'm from Portugal and I'm taking this course because I'm interested in Psychology and in Neuroscience. "
"Still annoyed by your grading system. &nbsp;I've been a teacher for over 20 years and have taken several coursera courses to evaluate for high school students. &nbsp;I don't see how I can recommend all courses for students to take. &nbsp;Some of the classes have been wonderful	 with straight forward results. &nbsp;This is a faulty system when a student can score mostly 80 % on quizzes and 71% on final and still fail a course.

"Hi Coursera<br />Thank you for all the wonderful courses you offer!<br />I do have a suggestion about course scheduling in general (all courses) - given that most of the courses currently release weekly material on Mondays and open the associated assessments on Fridays. One thing that may make life easier would be if the weekly course materials could be posted before the weekend (Thursdays perhaps	 to account for the global student community)	 with assessments following shortly thereafter. Unlike full-time students	 I suspect that many Coursera students have other commitments (work	 travel etc.) during the week. If we had both the material and assessments available before the weekend	 we could possibly make better use of our time.<br /> "

"Sir	&nbsp;<br /><br />Thank you . Its been a wonderful course.&nbsp;<br /><br />I wish even after the&nbsp;course&nbsp;&nbsp;is over we could access the OLI text book and the videos so that we could comeback and improve on our learning.

"it is cold and snowing in a small village in Germany	 where I am living since 1966. My name is Nam	 born in Vietnam and left the country when I was 19. Background: Engineer and Financial Planner (the 3rd qualification when I was 50). Built up a consulting company for private and financial planning. Meeting with clients and assisting them	 who have social problems in working places	 in family and in social environment. I wish to learn more in psychology	 which I started to study by my own with books and discussions with experts. I just wanted to help people more effective. Also I wanted to demonstrate to my friends and my family's members	 that there is a huge richness and the beauties in our environments which I always can learn from. Just look for it	 and I find it. "
Many thanks to Professor Smith and his entire team for making this course so enjoyable. I still have severe reservations about peer assessment as an appropriate grading methodology but I have really benefited from the course and hope that you may consider offering other courses in the future.<br /><br />

"<b>Sometimes we have to assess where we are coming from. It's not fair to get back on other students because you were thinking you got low.

Otherwise we can all just use the thesaurus the whole day and change the English words.</b><br /><b>&nbsp;That's why I believe that we should follow Alex. If there is no follower to leadership	 there will be chaos. We have to respect his instruction</b><br /><b>And remember	 the principle of getting back what you gave to the world.

If you planted love you will reap the same. </b><br /><b>It's a matter of using your conscience	 because we all know that there is already a big miscommunication regarding the instructions or directions of what should have &nbsp;been done in the assignment. Some focussed on methodology	 such as checking internal and external validity because of the word ""how we gather the data"" makes things confusing.. Therefore	 if we will try to be a little kinder to one another	 we don't have to be over strict with rules and regulations. Further	 the assignments that we have submitted are not going into major newspaper publications that we should be so strict with each other. Second	 everyone should have been a little&nbsp;relaxed&nbsp;re. copying words from text books or journals&nbsp;&nbsp;because of the word from Alex in first assignment that plagiarism is not to be dealt seriously (or to that effect).&nbsp;Therefore you should give those students some benefit of the doubt because they are just following Alex word 	 not because they are dishonest people.<br /> And I will recommend to Alex and the entire staff to give penalty to those checkers who did not follow rules and regulations as to the checking of the papers. Such as if they receive complaints as to rechecking and found out how some people murdered the grading; that&nbsp;they should be severely penalized 	 because we were told that evaluation tasks will also be part of our grades. </b> "

"The announcements say the final exam involves 30 questions of which 10 were to be considered the questions for the last lectures. However there were 35 questions involved. Anyway	 I hope my afore given calculations will be considered right. It is unfair to reduce the score of the final exam with a quizz questions. But	 the staff can argue that the first 10 questions of the last lectures should also be partially attributed to the final exam. Then from the first 10 questions approxiametely 1 should be allocated to the final exam. In that case my calculations would be (given that my wrong answer should be attributed to the final exam):<br />quizzes: ((103 plus 9)/12 x 0.3 = 2.8<br />assignments: 3.44<br />final exam: 24/25 x 0.3 x 10 = 2.88<br />Grand total: 9.12 = 91.2%.

"I have the same issue - I submitted 45 minutes late because I didn't pay attention that the deadline is referred to Eastern Time.<br />Anyway	 I still would like to see the feedback on my pre-test	 given that I spent time on it and OLI received my&nbsp;answers for research purpose. "

"&nbsp;enough had been said	 let's concentrate on the final exam and the two remaining quizzes. Good luck to everyone! Fail or pass	 let's just enjoy the remaining days!<br /> "
"I missed one quizz and on one i was late for subjective reasons (internet line down on quizz 8)	 quizz 9 I was one day late because of dealing with negative emotions of missing previous quizz possibly :).<br />My question is	 will you offer discounts on missed deadlines. I do not require a certificate but the evaluation of my performance would be good to have all in one. "
I totally agree I find myself doing that a lot it really makes me feel uplifted. 
Now all are available and downloadable.<br /> 
Kindly take it as a compliment professor Smith :) 
hello<br />wanted to please were reviewed my notes herror &nbsp;<br />thanks 
I'm just not sure how I should feel about my score because I don't know what the highest possible score is.&nbsp; Anyone know what the highest possible score is on the first written assignment 'design an experiment'?<br /> 
"Instead of complaining about the vagueness of the assignment	 I'm throwing my energy into finding good resources. I think we can safely mention a resource we found	 but whoever uses the resource&nbsp;has to do the work of gleaning helpful information from it and deciding if it's appropriate for their purpose.<br /><br />With that understanding	 there is a video available through the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) on the web: <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/mind-rampage-killer.html"" target="""">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/mind-rampage-killer.html</a><br /><br />It's called ""Mind of a Rampage Killer"" and it includes some discussion on nature vs. nurture.<br /><br />I don't know if it is available everywhere; it's based in the U.S. <br /><br />Good luck everyone!

"hello	 greek coursarians. i am NAME2800162oula and i am from piraeus. i loved psycology since my early years but never had the time to study same when i was young. so now i am so glad to have this cha nce	 thanks to coursera	to learn the basics in the filed of psycology.and happy that we can have conversation with you. let someone organize a group for greeks so have meetings	 talks and help each other. "
Maybe someone needs to notify Coursera or GeorgiaTech about this fiasko! 
"Thank you for your reply Alex. &nbsp;I wasn't thinking that the quiz could be extended purely for myself but more in general that this is probably an issue for other students too. &nbsp;Being very keen	 I wouldn't like to miss a quiz! "
"I feel the same way	 I love the course - so far I have learned a tremendous amount. Thanks a lot for that!<br /><br />As far as the evaluation rubrics are concerned: I really don't understand why we were not able to see the evaluation questions <b>before</b> the assignments had to be submitted	 as I would have reworded some paragraphs had I known them when I wrote the text. The question ""Did the student say that the data would be analyzed?""	 for example	 may mean that I will be missing out on 3 credit points because I did not specifically say that ""the data will be analyzed"" but instead elaborated on what the collected data would be able to show	 depending on the outcome of the experiment. And does it warrant 3 credit points if somebody simply writes ""And in the end	 the data will be analyzed""?<br /> "
"I am trying to access material for Week 6 and all I get is a ""System Error""! ? "
"Hello	 I am NAME2455936. I am Polish	 but currently I am living in the Czech Republic. I am 32. I am an MA in Ethnolinguistics and recently I completed an MBA studies. I work for a major IT services company as a project manager.<br />I've been always keen to understand why people behave the way they do.<br /> "
"Now that quiz 7 deadline is over	 I would like to point out an error with question 4 of quiz 7. The correct answer as per the system does not seem to be correct. Further there two correct answers amongst the choices given. Let me clarify:<br /><p>1. Question 4 (quiz
7) reads: Harlow and Harlowâ€™s research on monkeys raised with artificial mothers
suggests that mother-infant emotional bonds result primarily from mothers
providing infants with __.</p>

<p>2. The correct answer
given by the system: &nbsp;â€˜Bodily contactâ€™. </p>

<p><span>3. I feel the system
generated correct answer mentioned above is not correct as mere â€˜bodily contactâ€™
could be provided by both the artificial mothers. What is more relevant is the <i>comfort</i>
provided by the warm terry-cloth mother. </span></p>

<p>4. Further his question
has multiple correct responses amongst the choices given. I quote the following
four sentences from the OLI page 136:</p>

<p><span>(a) The Harlows found
that although the infant monkeys went to the wire mother for food	 they
overwhelmingly preferred and spent significantly more time with the warm
terry-cloth mother that provided no food but did provide <i>comfort</i>. </span></p>

<p><span>(b) The
studies by the Harlows showed that young monkeys preferred the warm mother that
<i>provided a secure base</i> to the cold mother that provided food.</span></p>

<p><span>(c) Both
monkeys and human babies need a <i>secure base</i> that allows them to <i>feel
safe</i>. </span></p>

<p><span>(d) From
this (read secure) <i>base</i>	 they can gain the confidence they need to <i>venture
out and explore their worlds.</i></span></p>

<p><span>5. <i>Comfort</i> (not
merely bodily contact) provided by the mother makes the baby <i>feel safe</i> (<i>protection
from harm</i>)	 making it act like a <i>secure base</i> from where it can </span><i>venture
out and explore the world</i>. As a result of this	 the following options
of answer are all correct: </p>

<p>(a) Protection from
harm</p>

<p>(b) The opportunity to
explore.</p><br /> "
"I don't see how that is possible	 anonymous...&nbsp; Mathematically	 without the final being averaged in	 it is not possible to achieve a 90%.&nbsp; Even a 70% requires a perfect score on every assessment	 including peer assessments. "
My outline shows modules 46-53 for week 11 and 53-56 for week 12. Looks like to me that the module numbers should be 40-46 for week 12 and 47-50 for week 12. What's correct? 
"I get 3 of 5 for dependent variable	 mentioning it in experiment description and then separately wrote:&nbsp;<br /><b>Experiment variables:</b><br /><b>---------------------------</b><br /><b>&lt;. . . &gt;</b><br /><b>Dependent variable: Object detection&nbsp;quickness.</b><br /><b>Operational definition:&nbsp;Time until object(s) is detected (min:sec).</b><b>&nbsp;</b><br /><br />And additionally mentioned it while proving that experiment is valid	 reliable	 ethical	 independent variable occurs prior to dependent etc.<br /><span>Anybody have a clue where I'm wrong?</span> "
Many thanks Hal for all your efforts and truly appreciate it. 
It confused me too. It is also described in a diagram in the OLI as a 'brain region controlling the pituitary gland.'&nbsp;

Cross cultural psychologists want to understand what processes are universal and what processes are culturally dependent. They are doing so by comparing people from different cultures. <br /> 
"I was under the impression that even if you are not on Signature Track	 there will be a Statement of Accomplishment (SoA) for those who pass this course with a 70% or higher grade. <br /><br />The important thing to note	 however	 is that only Signature Track VERIFIES that it you who achieved that accomplishment (by verifying your identity each time you do an assessment). Standard Coursera SoA's have a clause that points out that the Statement ""...does not verify the identity of the student.""<br /><br />So	 if you are doing this for yourself	 the SoA is nice to have	 but if you want to use it in a more formal or professional context	 Signature Track is better.<br /><br />Hopefully	 this helps to clarify things.<br /> "

"I think that there is far too much variation in the way the rubric was interpreted and used.

"You are kidding? &nbsp;The grading policy was set out on the syllabus page right from the start of this course - the week 12 test IS the final exam. &nbsp;So even though the first 10 questions are from week 12	 those questions are part of the final exam. &nbsp;Where on earth is the confusion? "

"I have been in college for 40 years.

This course format	 structure and instructor	 has far exceeded in helping me learn beyond any traditional course I've taken. &nbsp;This format of learning as stimulus presented in lecture then via interactive text (offers stimuli	 association and reinforcement interactively) is truly amazing and so incredible for learning. &nbsp;This will influence traditional education in a most positive way. &nbsp;Hope it comes soon. "
"A certain percentage of the students are always negative in their behavior and may give you a low grade on the PA without any reason. Matter of normal distribution. Although 3 peers - I suppose randomely assigned - did review every assignment and they were anonymous	 you may have still a chance to have 3 peers with a negative attitude toward their peers.<br />May be it is a suggestion that the staff would do a regrading in the case a student did score low on the PA without plausible reason and hence did not pass the 70% treshold. It is just a suggestion. Good luck.<br /> "
So you think the reason teenage girls get pregnant so early is because they.have a mixed up relationship with her parents. That makes a lot of sense.

"<p><span>Hi all
<br />
My opinion	 this course is fantastic and very rich in content. I did not expect
it to be so engaging and thorough. I am learning heaps	 coming from a sociology
background and haven just applied for my MSc Cognitive Neuropsychology I couldnâ€™t
have found a better intro to Psychology as I prepare to start my programme. Thumbs
up for Cousera and for those that feel otherwise I don't know what to say to
them :(<br />
Enjoy!</span><span><br />

"Not only the transmitters need time to be reuptaken by the synapse	 but the axon also needs time to  return to its normal resting potential. So there is a time	 where the neuron can't fire (and it won't react to signals in that time).<br />In Modul 5 it is said	 that a neuron can fire 1	000
            times each second...<br /> "
"I must say I found this course structure not motivating at all. The OLI is brilliant	 but the video classes are very limited. I came to the conclusion there was no need for the videos at all	 we could have red the book only. Unfortunately reading takes much more time and videos can be listened in an increased speed	 so at the end I had to give up	 because there is no way to have enough time to prepare for the quizzes	 unless the deadlines would have been extended for people with limited time. This all would make sense if you are not working full time etc. &nbsp; "
"The problem summary:I am trying to go into my OLI textbook to study it will not show up	 it looks like what I am seeing is the program&nbsp; rather then what I have been seeing all along. as it has things like pick file	 browse insert in the middle and enter a latex equation on the left side along with LaTeX	 on the right is HTML and MD .......can someone please help so I can finish my OLI and do the final. <br />thank you!<br /><br />Steps to reproduce:<ol><li></li></ol><br />Screenshot:<br /><br /> "

I think I'm not the only one confused here	 so I would appreciate that we could be clarified on this.<br /><br />Thank you</span> "
"The exam	 like all the other quizzes is closed book Amy	 so no looking at the powerpoints while taking it! &nbsp;I calculate that with your assignments and full marks for all quizzes you would need to get about 26 of the 35 questions right in the final exam in order to pass. &nbsp;Bit confused about the lack of internet access during evaluations though	 as you posted on the forums during that time??

"Dr. Smith mentioned calcium level in the bloodstream in one of his lectures	 and I'm seeing again in Week 2 that calcium in the blood is regulated by the parathyroids.&nbsp;<br /><br />I've heard of potassium levels in the blood being critical for normal heart function	 but have never heard anyone reference calcium levels.&nbsp;<br /><br />What is significant about calcium levels in the blood? Will that be a topic that is covered later?&nbsp; "
"Really? &nbsp;I'm glad I took the test early without the stress of being close to the deadline	 then having system failures causing me to be unable to submit at around the deadline	 then being uncertain whether or not there would be an extension. &nbsp;I'm glad that a few people have a second chance and I don't begrudge them that. &nbsp;I really don't think they have an advantage!

Hi! This is Dr. NAME3045830 from India. Though earned my Ph.D in Management I have always been interested to know psychological science of human brains. 'Human' which is most important resource for any business. 
Hello!! please help me!! I canÂ´t see my grades!!! Where i can find them?? thanks!!<br /> 
"May be of interest for those who use Google Chrome. I found an application called Read Later Fast that allows me to right click on the OLI page and download it for review offline (I don't have internet access where I am staying so must go out to do my study/tests). I'm not affiliated in any way to the developers	 just hoping this will help others. Enjoy. "
"I got 8/10 in the first&nbsp;Quiz	 I cannot be happier!!! As&nbsp;English&nbsp;is not my native&nbsp;language It took me really a lot of time&nbsp;studding&nbsp;for the first test. I did it in two weeks instead of one. Hope I can catch up&nbsp; "

Hi. I'm hoping we could share opinions and have helpful discussions each other. Nice to meet you. 
"hunger pangs occur many hours after eating when food out of stomach. &nbsp;It is due to migrating motor complexes that begin in the antrum and go down the small bowel ridding the gut of undigestible foods. &nbsp;This is what gives hunger pangs. &nbsp;By the way	 glycogen is mis-pronounced in the lecture. "
EMAIL16912 It tells you the OLI units to read in the Syllabus link on the left.&nbsp; 
I have just finished the OLI material and done the test. I think that at the beginning of the course it was told that we have to do the test in Module 52.&nbsp; When should we do this test after Final Quizz or after the course is closed? <br /><br />Thank you very much.<br /> 
"Hi Anitha	<br />All (1) Lecture videos	 (2) Sub-title Texts and (3) PDF Slides are fully downloadable.<br />It is a good practice to download all the three resources and keep them for revision. We will need them for the final test.<br />The OLI Text is NOT downloadable. However	 in cases of videos forming part of OLI	 you can go to their source in youtube and download them.<br /><br /> "

"You are right regarding the lowest score on the test. Announcement that you can only take ones a test was however wrong.<br /><br />It is true that there is no fundamental law that prescribes that the final exam can't have more questions than average related to week 12.&nbsp; Except the law of consistency! <br /><br />If the staff didn't want to make a separate quiz for week 12 than why did the staff announced that questions regarding week 12 are part of the final exam? For what reason? They could have written: no week 12 questions	 but questions regarding to week 12 are part of the final exam. It is INCONSITENT to have 12 questions of 35 in the final exam regarding Week 12? Was Week 12 than so important with regard to other weeks materials? Since the staff did not annoucne anything like that it is fair to assume that that is not the case. So the crucial question for me is why to have appr. 1/3rd of the final exam questions on the material of week 12? For me it is unclear. May be you know the answer; I do not.<br /><br />P.S. Of course	 there are no rules. They could also have 35 questions regarding Week 12 or Week 8 etc. But it is not consistent to have appr. 1/3rd of the Final exam questions on only one week materials? (It is common practice that a Final exam covers all the materials of all the weeks (1-12) in approximately the same percentages	 or not?) <br /> "

"The problem summary:<br />Quiz 5 permitted me to submit my answers when I had not selected anything for question 5.&nbsp; I think it is best to let the quiz require you to make a selection for all questions since: a) no one would rationally fail to make even an uneducated guess in light of the chance that this could increase their score and b) there is a good likelihood that a person intended to make a selection by missed the mark with their pointing device and overlooked this.&nbsp; <br /><br />In addition	 when this occures	 under the 'explanation' column	 you get nothing for that question which means you don't get to learn what the answer should have been as you would if you had answered the question rightly or wrongly.&nbsp; This fact shows that an absent answer was not anticipated by the program code.&nbsp; I am pretty sure I would have got the answer right but in my case my cat scratched my left eye yesterday and I took the quiz at all only with great effort as I can not see or read well right now with my eyes watering profusely all the time and squinting. (I can type reasonably well oddly enough because I am a fast typist relying little on vision for it).&nbsp; Because of this I didn't bother to check my answers nearly as carefully as I normally would have.&nbsp; But there will be other students with vision issues permanent or temporary as in my case who would be greatly assisted by this 'double-check' in the program code.&nbsp; At the least	 the student should get the answer back if they for some reason chose not to answer a question.<br /><br />Steps to reproduce:<ol><li>Open a quiz</li><li>answer all but one question (question five in my case)</li><li>submit quiz<br /></li></ol><br />Screenshot:<br /><br /><img src=""https://coursera-forum-screenshots.s3.amazonaws.com/08/d1e6646fe27bc5719ba622edc92e0e/q5oli.jpg"" alt=""image"" /><br /> "
"Yes	 that was the same I felt:( Just got 5 points in a mood of learned helpless;) "
"TIP for quiz takers: If you are having trouble with the quiz	 go to the bottom of the page and click on ""save"" instead of ""submit."" This allows you to review the material again and come back to the quiz. Your quiz is not finished or scored until you actually submit it	 so this gives you some review time. And no	 it's not cheating; it's the way Coursera is set up. I hope this helps you to increase your scores on the next quiz. "

Does this mean that this was never Professor Smith's course? He just added some videos to go with the OLI? 
I don't think we get a grade for evaluation as such? &nbsp;Just if we <i>don't</i> evaluate we lose some (I think 20%) of the marks we would otherwise have received for that assessment.

<p>Henry G. Molaison	 known as H.M.	 in the 1970s. He had a memory 
impairment after surgery to treat epilepsy	 and his brain has been widely 
studied. </p></div></div>
<div>
<p>â€œPrior to Brenda Milnerâ€™s discoveries	 many 
behaviorists and some cognitive psychologists followed the lead of Freud and 
Skinner in abandoning biology as a useful guide to the study of memory	â€ the 
Nobel laureate Dr. Eric Kandel wrote in his memoir	 â€œIn Search of Memory.â€ 
â€œMilnerâ€™s work changed all that.â€ </p>
<p>The amnesia patient	 Henry Molaison (known during his 
lifetime only as H.M.	 to protect his privacy)	 <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/us/05hm.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"" target="""">died 
at 82 in 2008</a>; his brain is now being <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/health/22brain.html?ref=henrygustavmolaison"" target="""">dissected 
and digitally mapped</a> in exquisite detail. </p>
<p>But Dr. Milner is still very much alive. Two months 
short of her 95th birthday	 she puts in full days at the <a href=""http://www.mni.mcgill.ca/"" target="""">Montreal 
Neurological Institute and Hospital</a>	 where she is studying left/right brain 
differences. </p>
<p>We spoke in her offices here at â€œthe Neuroâ€ and at the 
annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 
Boston. Here is a condensed and edited version of the conversations. </p>
<p><b>How did you come to work with H.M.	 perhaps 
the most famous patient in the history of neuroscience?</b> </p>
<p>In 1950	 while working on a doctorate at McGill	 I 
went to work here at the Montreal Neurological Institute to study the patients 
of Dr. Wilder Penfield. Heâ€™d created the Neuro as a place to pioneer the 
neurosurgical treatment of epilepsy. Heâ€™d developed a procedure for patients who 
were having epileptic seizures because of brain injuries where heâ€™d excise the 
injured part of the brain. </p>
<p>One of the things I did was to try to help Dr. 
Penfield pinpoint where the seizures were coming from. This was really detective 
work. In the early 1950s	 there wasnâ€™t imaging technology to let us see the 
brain anatomically. I used EEGs and developed tests based in part on research I 
was doing. </p>
<p>And then	 within a short period of time	 we saw two 
patients	 P.B. and F.C.	 who presented with something weâ€™d never seen before. 
After their surgery	 their ability to form long-term memory was gone â€” though 
their immediate memory and intelligence remained intact. I remember P.B. saying	 
â€œWhat have you people done to my memory?â€ Dr. Penfield and I hypothesized that 
there was damage on one side of the brain that we couldnâ€™t have seen	 and when 
he excised the other side he deprived these patients of the function of the 
region. We then wrote that theory up and presented it in an abstract to a 
meeting of the American Neurological Association in Chicago. </p>
<p><b>Did that lead to your meeting H.M.?</b> 
</p>
<p>Yes. Directly. Afterward	 Dr. NAME2332101 Scoville	 a 
surgeon in Hartford	 telephoned and said	 â€œIâ€™ve just read your abstract and Iâ€™m 
seeing the same thing in an epileptic patient on whom I carried out an 
operation.â€ Dr. Scoville then invited me to come to Hartford to study this 
person. That patient was H.M. </p>
<p><b>What was H.M. like?</b> </p>
<p>He was very pleasant. And he so wanted to be helpful. 
At the time I met him	 he must have been in his late 20s. Heâ€™d had really 
terrible epilepsy ever since a childhood bicycle accident	 and the surgery had 
been beneficial for that. But the excision had made it difficult for him to 
acquire new long-term memories. </p>
<p>There were things about the past he recalled	 but heâ€™d 
tell you the same joke over and over again	 never remembering heâ€™d told it to 
you earlier. No matter how many times you met him	 he couldnâ€™t remember you. 
</p>
<p>I would give him tests where he had to repeat a set of 
numbers â€” 5	 8	 4. He could do it by constantly repeating those numbers to 
himself or making up formulas. Yet	 if I distracted him â€” and life is constantly 
distracting â€” he could no longer give you 5	 8	 4. This was the heart of his 
incapacity. </p>
<p><b>What kinds of tests did you give him?</b> 
</p>
<p>I had to show what he could learn and not learn. It 
was no good to say	 â€œI have this patient and he cannot learn anything new	â€ 
because someone will say	 â€œBrenda	 what did you try to teach him?â€ </p>
<p>So I would hop on a train and go down to Hartford and 
give H.M. tasks based on learning. One was a puzzle where he had to trace his 
way out of a maze. He just couldnâ€™t do it. A different one involved giving him a 
five-pointed star and asking him to trace its outlines while looking in a 
mirror. This looks easy	 but is not. With most people	 the more they practice	 
the better they get. This is really a test for motor-skill learning. Well	 H.M. 
did it!</p><p></p><div><p>Seeing this was probably the most exciting thing that 
ever happened to me. As H.M. tried tracing the star â€” over 30 times in a 
three-day period â€” he showed a beautiful learning curve. He couldnâ€™t recall any 
of the 30 tries	 but he got better. </p></div>

<p>A section of H.M.'s cerebellum appears shrunken compared with a

<div>
<p><b>What did that mean?</b> </p>
<p>That there are different kinds of learning and that 
autobiographic memory	 or long-term memory	 isnâ€™t the whole of memory. </p>
<p><b>In the 1950s	 what was the prevailing idea 
about memory?</b> </p>
<p>There was this strange idea that memory was a function 
of the whole brain. The breakthrough was really to show that you couldnâ€™t talk 
about memory as a great global function of the whole brain. Itâ€™s very dependent 
on particular areas. </p>
<p>But also that memory itself is multifaceted. Our 
memory is our autobiography	 and H.M.â€™s autobiographical memory had been 
disturbed. After a critical part of his brain had been removed	 H.M. couldnâ€™t 
build up memories of his life as he lived it. At the same time	 he could acquire 
some motor and some perceptual skills	 which meant that there were different 
forms of learning and they involved different systems of the brain. </p>
<p><b>Did you like H.M.?</b> </p>
<p>We all loved H.M. Yet it was very strange	 
psychologically	 because when he died we all felt as if weâ€™d lost a friend. And 
this is funny because one thinks of friendship as a bilateral thing. He didnâ€™t 
recognize us or know us	 and we felt weâ€™d lost a friend. </p>
<p><b>Youâ€™re British. How did you come to live and 
work in Canada?</b> </p>
<p>During World War II	 I was a civilian research officer 
employed by the British Ministry of Supplies. And it was there that I met Peter 
Milner. He designed equipment to measure the tracking skills of radar operators. 
As a psychologist	 I was charged with trying out these systems out on people. 
Well	 every now and then the thing I was testing would break down and Iâ€™d have 
to call in Peter. Soon Peter was interested in psychology and I was interested 
in Peter. Radar brought us together. </p>
<p>Around 1944	 he was asked to be part of a team setting 
up research on the beginnings of Canadian atomic energy. We hadnâ€™t intended to 
get married. I had never intended to marry anyone because I never wanted 
children. But it was marriage or goodbye	 and we werenâ€™t ready yet for goodbye. 
So we got married	 and three weeks later we departed for the New World. </p>
<p>We divorced in the 1970s. There were reasons	 but we 
remained perfectly friendly and we spoke every day. We never stopped being 
friends. Heâ€™s my best friend. We go to the movies. We cook meals. We donâ€™t live 
together. We live a few blocks from each other. </p>
<p><b>You are 95 and you still work â€” </b></p>
<p>Iâ€™m 94! I like to tell cabdrivers my age because they 
say	 â€œYou donâ€™t look it.â€ </p>
<p>And yes	 I do work. I have postdocs. Iâ€™ve always been

"Hi all	

I'm NAME1074505 and I live near Cologne in Germany. I'm working as an IT professional for an insurance company and I'm 43 years old. I've been interested in psychology for a long time.

"Hi all	<br />we all have spent six weeks already for the course of Dr. Smith. Not only enjoying the lectures and the content of the course	 I especially feel being encouraged and happy by the help and friendly posts of my classmates. I appreciate the lectures of Dr. Smith with his natural appearance	 his sympathic voice - so after all	 I wish that I could see and meet all of you in a real classroom. There I can see smiling faces and the dynamic of young people and having conversations with the classmates at my age (65); we can have a cup of coffee in the campus and exchange what we learn from the course and our real lives. I can imagine	 there would be a great social enrichment besides of the course for psychology.<br />So thank you to Dr. Smith and your staff	 and certainly to some of you	 no matter where you are in this world	 having provided me support whenever I had a question related to the course. With these persons I also could set up a peer-to-peer private relationship via LinkedIn network.<br />I look forward to further steps of this course - and let us accomplish our study successfully	 which I do have any doubt at all!<br />Kind regards	<br />Nam NAME2982155 (Germany) "

"I got a 7/20 I think.<br /><br />I'm fine with scoring low	 after all I'm not knowledgeable about every aspect in psychology	 that's why I want to pick it up.<br /><br />But the dream question really made me bewildered because it defeats all the information I had known previously about dreams. Not that I didn't know most normal people said they don't have dreams because they can't remember them but because that question didn't seem to consider all&nbsp;possibilities&nbsp;there were	 for example	 brain injuries.<br /><br />But it seems it's because of the way the questions are phrased.

"Please Dr. Alex	 my&nbsp;OLI&nbsp;post-test was not accepted due to time schedule. I did not pay attention to the time difference between my country and the USA.

I take notes as well. It helps me retain things more.<br /> 
Will NOT participating in the pre and post test hinder ones chances of getting a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction if the criteria is still met? <br /> 
"In my humble opiniÃ³n ""the data would be analyzed"" it's just a plain stupid statement. I mean	 what else&nbsp;could you&nbsp;&nbsp;do with the data	 a cheesburger? Take the data out for a walk? Do some meth?<br /><br /><br />I&nbsp;scored 14	 and I am sick of writing assigments	 I flunked already two courses	 Gamification and introduction to Irrational Thinking	 due to this	 and got 10 in the quizes	 the whole course flushed down the toilet due to 3 ramdon ( insert exlicit word) who couldÂ´t give a hoot about a fair grading. "
Opening it in a new tab worked for me. 
"I personally find this a much better (clearer) example:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-lN8vWm3m0"" target="""" title=""Link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-lN8vWm3m0"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-lN8vWm3m0</a>. Btw	 you only close your lips once while saying ""psychodynamic"" - during the ""m""	 ""ps"" is pronounced as ""s"". "
I <i><b>DO</b></i> agree with all of you. I had the same issue: my answer was considered a wrong one as you discussed above.<br />Nam 
"<b>See OLI Unit 15 Module 50 -Effectiveness</b>:- <b><i>Effectiveness of Social-Community Approaches</i></b><br /><br />""Although some of the many community-based programs . . . . .""<br /><br /><br /> "
"Well	 here we are. For many of us the course is over; we finished our work	 suffered through the ridicuously inadequate grading rubris and took the final. NOW they tell us that if we achieve an overall grade of 90% or higher	 we will pass <i>with distinction</i>. The ""carrot"" of incentive for this effort is typically&nbsp;being dragged behind the horses a**.&nbsp; That pretty much sums up my experience here. I'm glad it's over. "
"Hi	 Iryna and others:) 
I am Ukrainian too. Nice to meet you in this unusual way! "
"<p>Thank you	 Michelle!</p>

"Hello	 thanks for the hint: I wasn't able to access the peer evaluation when i used google chrome. Unfortunately (for Zhang) I was wrong: It's been another assignment I graded. The reason why I mixed it up is that both used the experimental method to proof a point. Sorry	 false-alarm "
"In Module 16 my iconic memory is inexistant as I cannot remember any of the lines that flash on the screen	 and as for my echoic memory in the test below	 I cannot hear any pattern at all	 simply white sound! &nbsp;Why is this? "
"The OLI states when discussing higher mental retardation rates in men:<br />'Some X-chromosome regions have been linked to mental         retardation	 and only males have a Y chromosome.'<br />This does not make sense to me.<br />Is this sentence correct? Shouldn't it be two times&nbsp;X chromosome	 or do I have too much Zzz chromosome? "
I too have many-many questions about the format our assignment must include. I think it would be highly helpful if the professor or Alex could once again guide us and tell us which pages from OLI we should read and give us a generic guideline about what's been asked in detail! 
"<div>That's it! I agree with you .... I did not mention the dependent variable and independent variable	 with these words	 and what about now? <br />So	 I will lost some points for that!?!?</div><div>The task was not well explained	 they should have said that we would need to clearly define the variables	 including using such words.</div> "
"What bothers me most is that the rubric left no openness for discussion	 it was as if they expected you to copy and paste what the people's finding were and their discussions and your whole view and ideas couldn't be processed. It's such as shame and it the first time I have seen a rubric so ""closed minded""! <br /> "
"I am not getting the link at all.&nbsp; When I did get something	 after several tries	 it was a message saying that the material was not ready for use. "
"If you go to the top left of your screen	 where your name appears	 click on the drop down list and you will see the ""course records"". Click on it and you will find the grades and the certificates!!<br /> "
Thanks a ton for the reply! 
good luck 
"Hello. My name is Vicky. I'm 17 years old and live in Russia. I've enrooled this course because I'm interested in Psychology. I hope I can end this course (I'm afraid that it will be too complite for me	 because I haven't got any primary educatoin on Psychiology at all)
 Good luck	 Courseans	 have a nice day) "
"Some of us are getting college credit	 I know my school just started accepting signature track as counting for credit	 that's why I took this class. "
"I agree	 in my experience final exams are more usually based fairly evenly across the entire course (although that is real life experience	 not Coursera	 which could well be in an alternate universe)	 &nbsp;I actually thought they were being kind to us by letting us know that just studying the final week could get us 1/3 of the marks. &nbsp; It made me less nervous	 although I revised everything. &nbsp;And I feel I have learnt a lot. &nbsp;As you said:&nbsp;<span>non scholae sed vitae.</span> "
The problem is with the lecture videos. The OLI videos are perfect. I do not have headphones. Is there any way the quality of the lecture videos can be improved? Ann&nbsp; 
"So much of the grading will depend on one's grasp of the English language	 i.e. if you understand another word for ""heredity""	 you would give the person the mark	 but if you are merely going to look for that particular word and it is not there	 of course you won't give the mark. &nbsp;I also noted that some assignments didn't note their references and yet another was a complete copy and paste but had every word that was being evaluated	 so I had to give that person full marks. &nbsp;Unfortunately a lot of good assignments will not get graded correctly. "
"The problem summary:<br />The second 'Learn By Doing' Exercise on page 44 in Module 9 has a mistake in the question.&nbsp;<br /><br />The given question is - ""In the list below	 for each of the senses	 pick the type of signal that goes along the nerve from&nbsp;the sensory receptor on the body to the brain.""<br /><br />This is the same question as the previous exercise on the same page. The question is supposed to be about the type of energy that is detected by a particular sense.<br /><br />Screenshot:<br /><img src=""https://coursera-forum-screenshots.s3.amazonaws.com/d0/6007e0484fccb90d9f7feea49ca42d/Screenshot-from-2013-04-16-ZIPCODE1.png"" style=""width:441px;height:248px;"" alt=""image"" /><br /><br /><br /> "

"<p>Will those struggling to mark to the guidelines just

"I know I'm writing in a kind of ""frustration"" and ""emotional rage"" but I'm interested in your opinion	 how many points would you give me for my assignment	 because sometimes	 my ""evaluation peers"" make me angry. :-)<br />&nbsp;Feel free to post your assignments too ;-)<br /><br /><br /><br /><p>In this assessment	 I'm going to describe and show you my results of an experiment	 that I did a few days ago. I was thinking	 what kind of experiment should I do	 and because my options are unfortunately limited	 I decided to try a experiment at my work - a department store	 that will test a kind of social conformity	 because I have been interested in this topic and been wondering	 how would it end.</p><p><b>Target</b>: Main topic of this experiment was to find	 how long will it take	 till someone in an mall's aisle picks up an item	 that fell from the shelf	 and return it back where it belongs. So the main object was to explore	 whether there is some correlation between number of people in aisles and time	 before that fallen item is picked up.&nbsp;</p><p>My methods were quite simple	 because I didn't want to do something too complicated (I don't think	 that's the intention of these assessments)	 but easily repeatible	 although I realize	 that this can lead to biased results	 but I will list all the pros and cons below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Procedure:</b>&nbsp;I've selected a number of aisles and divided them into three groups	 according to number of customers	 that went through them per hour. This was my<i>independent variable</i>	 that I manipulated (I chose	 into which aisle I put an item):&nbsp;</p><ol><li>few: &lt; 10 customers/ hour</li><li>medium: 10-30 customers/ hour</li><li>high: &gt;30 customers/ hour</li></ol><p>Then I've counted	 how long will it take	 till someone pick the item	 that I laid on the ground before (I've arranged it in order to be obvious that it ""fell""	 so no one left it there on purpose; therefore everything people had to do was bending their backs and return that item back to its shelf) and I also divided the results in three categories of time. This was my&nbsp;<i>dependent variable</i>&nbsp;(time should vary	 depending on number of people in an aisle).</p><ol><li>fast: it took less than 15 minutes</li><li>medium:&nbsp;&nbsp;it took between 15 and 30 minutes</li><li>long: it took more than 30 minutes</li></ol><div>In order to prevent biased results by my collegues	 I told no one that I'm going to do an experiment and I wasn't present in the aisle I chose after I laid the item	 in order to sustain ecological validity (my presence could have had an effect on the outcome). Overall I did 27 trials that are divided into the abovementioned categories. Results are in the table below:</div><div>&nbsp;</div><pre>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   fast(&lt;15 min)&nbsp; &nbsp;medium(15-30 min)   long(&gt;30 min)<br />few&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;          4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;            0<br />medium&nbsp; &nbsp;    2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;            6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp;        5<br />high&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;          1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;          1</pre><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>Evaluation</b>: According to previous social conformity experiments and hypothesis (eg Asch	 Milgram	 Sherif)	 high number of people should cause a&nbsp;<i>diffusion of responsibility</i>	 in my experiment	 this should lead to low numbers in &lt;15 min in high category and high numbers in &gt;30 min category. But as my results show	 this was not that case	 in fact	 the more people in an aisle	 the faster was the item picked up	 so there should be a slightly negative correlation (althought 5 tryouts in medium category show &gt;30 minutes delay; I suppose	 that there is some ""breaking point""	 that changes the situation). I think	 that high number of people in an aisle caused a kind of an ""activation state""	 that led people to be more aware of their surroundings and more willing to pick up an item and return it.&nbsp;</p><p>But the most astonishing thing	 that I observed was	 that before I have started	 I thought	 that the results will be biased by my collegues	 that should be more motivated to pick up an item from the ground (it is more or less a part of their job)	 but to my great amazement	 my collegues were often those	 who didn't pick up the item	 even though they went around it	 or were even standing by it	 I was really surprised and in fact disappointed by this observation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Pros and cons:</b></p><p><b><br /></b></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Pros</i></p><ul><li>ecological validity</li><li>relatively objective</li><li>easy to repeat</li><li>in this type of experiment	 probably well chosen variables</li></ul><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Cons</i></p><ul><li>low number of tryouts (27 isn't enough for some big impact)</li><li>small&nbsp;comprehensivity</li><li>possible bias of results (affected eg by people's mood or personality)</li><li>possible ethical problems (people didn't know	 that they were tested)</li><li>I suppose	 that this not a type of a great professional experiment	 there are better ways	 how to test conformity</li></ul> "

"<p>Yes	 Signature Track is optional. You'll get a certificate even if you do not join it. The advantage of joining is that after a couple of steps	 Coursera can verify that you are really you. It requires that you take a picture	 a picture of your identity and that you type a short pre written text that is your unique signature based on your unique typing pattern. After that	 every time you submit an assignment	 they require that you retake your picture and retype the short text which takes you no more than 2 minutes. I've joined to Signature Track for 2 other courses and will definitely do the same of this one. It's a way to give something back for this amazing opportunity that Coursera and the Universities involved are offering.</p> "

"I found some paragraphs in OLI text book very disturbing. Even if the topic Psychology is ''advanced'' I have the feeling it's addressed for kids or immature people.<br />Moreover some remarks are not correct ! Example from Module 6'' All animals have adapted to their environments by developing abilities that help them
			survive. Some animals have hard shells	 others run extremely fast	 and some have acute
			hearing. Human beings do not have any of these particular characteristics	 but we do
			have one big advantage over other animalsâ€”we are very	 very smart.'' <br />Since when do you have an advantage on animals regarding surviving ? I thought all living species still living were equals as they managed to ''survive'' evolution. It seem human did more than survive.This book is putting us on the top of the biological hierarchy. It reminds me of middle age...<br /> "

"Dr. Smith	 thank you very much for your teaching and your OLI textbook materials. You enrich my mind and my spirit. It's amazing to know I have a wonderful brain. Can I not use it in a good way during my life time? Surely	 I will and always will. Thanks to Hari and Alex also	 you are my guardian angels in this course. A billion thanks to all of you!<br /> "
"Hi. I'm a Spanish psychologist. &nbsp;If you need help	 you can contact me at Facebook (j david zarza) or a email at EMAIL1458 "
"<p>The course allows you to drop one quiz result in which you score the least	 which in your case can be the one you missed.. You should definitely continue with the course and attempt all the remaining quizzes. It will not affect your grades in the end...</p>
 "
"<div><p>I thought some questions were unclear and
sometimes ambiguous in ""learn by doing"" the OLI text and even in the&nbsp;quiz</p>

<p>eg: on OLI module 3</p>

<p>True or False; The American Psychological Association has
clear ethical guidelines governing the treatment of humans in psychological
research	 but it does not have similar guidelines governing the use of animals
in research.<br /></p>

<p>-&nbsp;APA has clear ethical guidelines governing the treatment
of humans in psychological research<br /></p>

<p>-&nbsp;APA has clear ethical guidelines governing the use of
animals in research</p>

<p>But are they similar? The guidelines are not similar	 items
are different but they are similar as they are ethical guidelines. For me this
is&nbsp;ambiguous&nbsp; not a clear question.<br /></p>

<p>&nbsp;Other:</p>

<p>A hypothesis states	 â€œPreschool education improves high
school graduation."" Which of the following would be an operational
definition?</p>

<p>- Attendance at a preschool for 2 years</p>

<p>- Attending preschool at age 4</p>

<p>&nbsp;if you say at age 4 it answers: attending preschool at age 4
is not a precise and measurable variable</p>

<p>if you say for 2 years it answers: This is a measurable
variable.</p>

<p>But is it measurable? I understand neither is really
measurable	 they both have many variables...</p>

<p>Other: ""variable that the experimenter manipulates""</p>

<p>Is it the variable that will be manipulated
in order to have the other manipulated? Or is it the variable that was&nbsp;manipulated&nbsp;by the first one? I&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;know&nbsp;which&nbsp;one was the question... is it obvious
for you all? Or is it obvious for the english-natives? Or neither?</p>

<p>Iâ€™m getting somewhat worried as this could
affect my results as when I know the answers sometimes Iâ€™m not&nbsp;sure&nbsp;of the
question.<br /></p></div><div><br />ps - maybe the ""<span>Preschool education improves high school graduation"" is not so unclear as the others :) but still...</span></div> "
Got 17 even though I made sure all of the steps were listed and bulleted. Even used may of the terms??? Go figure! <br /><br />I was obvious that many people misunderstood the assignment and grading instructions. 
I also got 0 for most of the positions (and just one brief comment!). And this makes 20% of the total grade for the course. Someone is cheating or..? :-)

"I'm taking another course alongside this (Python programming). &nbsp;In that course we submit our code each week for peer assessment. &nbsp;One week it seemed almost half the submissions were copied directly from code posted on somebody's blog. &nbsp; It didn't even work properly. &nbsp;We were instructed to grade ALL submissions according to the rubric and report all suspected plagiarism to the course staff (via email) to investigate. &nbsp;Thing is	 we don't know if that work is really plagiarised - worst case it could even be a deliberate trap to catch out unsuspecting self-appointed honour code police. &nbsp;The rubric is not that hard to follow. &nbsp;Follow it. &nbsp;Hit the Flag button on the Peer Assessment page and report any suspected violations that way. &nbsp;But don't just grade as zero because you <i>think </i>you put in more effort than they did. <br /><br />For the record: I am anonymous for personal reasons. &nbsp;This is my first post on this thread. &nbsp;My submission was not plagiarised	 although it was brief (pressure of time) and I can probably pass the course without the marks for this assessment.

"Let's make proposals for more appropriate grading rubrics.<br />&nbsp;<br />I suggest that the grading rubric should consist of only two questions:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) On a scale of 1 - 5	 how well do you feel&nbsp;the writing intelligently addressed the topic.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) On a scale of 1 - 5	 how much effort do you feel was put into the work.<br />If in doubt	 be generous.<br /><br />This is a&nbsp;great course and having participants from all over the world is so exciting.&nbsp; It is a&nbsp;privilege to read each other's work.&nbsp; <br /> "

Weren't we supposed to write assignment 1 all by ourselves? :DDD (Just a tiny trolling.)<br /> 
indeed with the combination of lecture videos and OLI you can achieve a high score and learn effefctively:))<br /><br />

"Im not saying that the text book isnt great	 at all	 im just saying that is really long for each module in each week	 im learning as well but the time spent per week is hard to carry on.&nbsp; "
"70% is the cut off for passing	 so even if the cut off for distinction is normally 85%	 than consider that a passing score is normally 60^. So	 70/65 x 80% (normal cut off for with distinction) gives 93	33% for a ""with distinction"". I think the cut off should be maintained at 90%.<br /><br />P.S. The quizzes and final were not really hard and the material was rather simple. <br />The staff has probably the data and therefore can sett a cut of at (e.g.) 2 x sigma.In other words only the 95% percentile gets a distinction. Lowering the standards is not wishful	 pushing harder is.<br /> "
Confused on the submit time for the assignment my time zone is mountain standard time however the timer stated that it was closed 39 mins ago at (2:39) but the time to submit on the assignment was 5:00pm<br />which time is it? 
"Hello Happy People!<br />Did I enjoy this course? YESssssssss... It's been such an honour to be part of this fantastic experience. The material and exercises are of very high standard.

"This is a good site	 Hi to you Phillip/Jimmy and good luck You are making some positive steps in your life and I know how hard it is. but five years clean it says a lot for you! HI Christine	 Alicia	 and Nancy. I think we are very lucky to be in the beginning of a new learning experience	 these classes online at no cost	 with really good professors from some great universities teaching us	 also Alex a great Teaching Assistant. This is new to me	 I am trying to get back to school in an online setting if I can	 I was not sure I could do this	 but I think I am doing okay. I love the way its set up	 first the lectures then the OLI with the interactive parts that lets us know where our weaknesses are so we can study more.&nbsp; Also	 I love that people from all over the world are in it along with me. Good luck to everyone in the class! <br /> "
"OLI Textbook	 when talking about the difference in IQ curve between men and women	 says (in ""did I get this"" comments) that only men have the X chromosome. Actually	 it should be Y (or maybe it should say that men have the only X chromosome). (Or maybe just better wording is needed.) <br /><br />Anyway	 it remains still unclear to me why X and Y chromosomes are linked to IQ at all. "
"As I found ""Amygdalum"" in a Latin dictionary	 the word is is obviously existing in Latin	 too.<br />Obviously Latin and Greek have a lot in common and maybe it is hard to tell	 in which language a word existed first...<br /><br /> "
"I don't take notes when I'm watching the video or reading the OLI. I believe it helps me to absorb more if I focus on one thing at once and this has been my learning style all the while. I don't like to take notes as notes taking hasn't helped me to improve my memory.<br /><br />However	 I do find the Learn By Doing and Did I Get It sections rather useful in the OLI. It helps me to remember something better if it left an impact on me	 for example making a mistake on a question. "
"I'm also taking to much time on each module	 I spent much more then 10h already and didn't finished yet :( I'm trying to do the same as&nbsp;<a href=""https://class.coursera.org/psy-001/forum/profile?user_id=PHONENUM"" target="""">Phoebe Sitara</a><span>&nbsp;and to don't skip anything	 the questions in the end of the page show me that I have to know&nbsp;which&nbsp;name did what	 etc	 it's my first lessons on psychology and the only names I knew was Pavlov	 Piaget and Freud :D not who did what etc	 and also we really have to really understand as in these questions they don't ask exactly what they said	 if you didn't get it and only memorized you can't answer the questions	 so I wonder if the quizz tomorrow will be like this and that I have to know exactly what Wundt did etc??? But it would be very very very good to know that we don't have to memorize all the names etc :D</span> "
I was wondering whether the OLI textbook will be available somewhere after the course has finished? It's a fantastic tool and it would be great to be able to reference it in the future when my recall has faded. 
It says I didn't pass. I really thought I'd done well enough on the quizzes and assignment #2 to compensate for the lousy job I did on #1.&nbsp;<br />Ah well. That's what I get for trying to study after being out of school for thirty years.

"Hello Everyone!

My name is Zsofi	 I'm 26 years old and I'm from Budapest	 Hungary.
I have always been interested in Psychology	 but 'til now never had the chance to actually gain more knowledge. So now	 for me the time has come	 and I'm very eager to learn more about these fascinating topics within Psychology. I have an extreme interest in Nutrition Sciences	 I'm sort of a nutrition freak :P
I'm sure this course has a lot to give me	 and I'm ready to take all of them!! 
This is my first course on Coursera and so far I'm totally amazed by its concept	 and I love the fact that we - students and also teachers - are from all over the world	 but still connected :)
Good luck to everyone	 and thanks for Coursera!! "

"I HAVE social phobia and all group of disorders which make for me difficult to live in a regular society<br />That is why i study by correspondence and that is why I joined Coursera: at least I have nothing to do with people face to face :)<br />And Yes it is true that peer assessment makes me anxious each time I have to submit my work and later to wait for the results. But what to do	 I want to study	 I want to learn. Even that sometimes I cry from anxiety but I'm doing my best! I prefer courses where there is no peer assessment but sometimes I have to accept that in course which I'm interested in there is this way of grading so this is only my choice if I enter such course and If I want to only audit the course or fully participate in it. Usually I do my best to do the second so I have to write sometimes and I have to peer assess. C'est la vie. <br /> "

"Hello all. My grades too where miscalculated. I should have received a score about 91%	 but I only received 88%.<br /><br />(overall quiz grades: 92%	 exam 97%	 assign1: 20	 assign2: 10	 total assignments: 85% = total grade 91%)<br /><br />Not a big deal not getting a distinction of course	 I still do get a statement	 and after all the important is what I've learnt and the material I got access too.<br /><br />But I think it is important to state the mistake so that it will be corrected in the future.

"One addition: Since the first 10 questions on quizzes 12 represented week 12 and I made 2 mistakes	 the actual calculation for the quizes should be: ((103 plus 8)/12) x 0.3 = 2.775<br />Assignments: 3.44<br />Final exam: 25/25 x 0.3 x 10 = 3.0<br />Grand total: 9.215.

"I would look in to a low inflammatory	 low sugar diet to begin with.  The brain is sort of the hungriest and thirstiest organ in the body - very sensitive to bio-chemical imbalances.  Fish oil	 Omega 3	 and DHA will all help you	 but you should avoid wheat	 rice	 sugar and other inflammatory and items high in starch or sugar- just reduce them if nothing else.

Secondly - I would avoid video games and computer screens to some extent- but especially video games.  This is an intuitive call - one you can think about.  If you research this the verdict is not out on the effects.  

With regard to the above two suggestions	 you probably are awair that ADHD sufferers are known to disproportionately crave both video games and also sugars.  It seems to me that this is a part of the neuro-chemical piece of the pathology.  There will be other pieces and I would definitely speak with a wise clinician if you have recourse to one to look at all possible areas.

Finally here is a link to an interesting NPR piece on neuro-feedback therapies which seem to be fairly effective for treatment of ADHD (and considering your interest in therapies avoiding medication	 this seems germane): http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1PHONENUM2 "

"<p>Hi there... It&#39;s nice to be able to discuss views with people with common interests...  I do agree with what you said to a large degree.. Changing a behaviour  merely to avoid pain or any other form of punishment is not good..in this instance for eg	use of abusive words very often might be an expression of some deep seated anger or aggression.. Repressing it or trying to change it will not be helpful then. Infact the anger or aggression may find a different way of expressing itself which may be even worse...  Hence it requires a much deeper introspection and understanding of human nature and personality to bring a change in such behaviour if needed...as u said behaviour is just the tip of the iceberg..it&#39;s an outcome of interaction of several complex internal processes...</p>
<p>What  I meant though was many times we do a lot of things just out of habbit.. Habits we are consciously aware of and want to stop or change but unable to do so simply because we don&#39;t remember or are not aware of doing them at that time when its hapenning..The idea is to associate that behaviour then with an action that will act as a reminder for us every time that behaviour occurs again... Pinching was just an abstract eg I gave..it can be anything silly that u can think of..
It works the other way round too.. If there is a task that u keep forgetting to do often only to remember later	try associating it with some other action..</p>

"<p>Hi Jennifer.. Anal retentive is a term often used to describe a person who is exceptionally orderly	often obsessed with cleanliness and tidiness.. The term originates from the psychodynamic theory.

"Anja Savic	<br /><br />You may want to hear from the Course Staff. However	 let me state the common method here.<br />Two Peer Assessments account for 40% of the final grade. Assume that the just concluded assignment accounts for 20% of the final grade.<br /><br />The maximum score possible is 23 in the first assignment. This 23 accounts for 20 in the final grade. You can proportionately calculate your score. Simply put	 [(20 / 23) x your score] will likely be the part of final grade.<br /><br />As for quizzes	 the instructions are that out of 11 quizzes	 only 10 quizzes will be included for a share of 30% in the final grade. To give the benefit to the student	 her lowest score among 11 will be dropped and the remaining 10 will be taken. In effect	 each quiz accounts for 3% in the final grade.<br /><br />If any one failed to submit one quiz among 11	 the 10 quizzes she attempted will qualify for final grade.<br /><br /> "

In submitting the answers for quiz 6 i was late by 20 minutes. Can something be done to give me credit for the quiz.&nbsp; 
"Firstly I would like to state that I hope this is counted as constructive criticism from someone who wants to use the courseware but is struggling with some usability aspects. These issues I feel	 are not helping my ""learning experience""	 I have indeed thought of not continuing with the course given the workload and time I will have to spend on it. This thought has frustrated me greatly	 especially as I think the meat of the course	 it's material	 is extremely well done and of high quality.<br /><br />I understand there is a learning curve with all new software and I have spent a number of hours now trying to get to grips with this. I also understand that my own preferred learning style may colour some of my criticisms. I have 14 years experience of designing/testing and delivering software including training software	 so I hope that this criticism will be listened to.<br /><br />1. Usability. My main issue is with the OLI textbook being embedded within the main page/tab of the Coursera site. This greatly reduces the visible area and impedes readability	 certainly on the laptop I am using (. Having two scroll bars on the screen at any time adds clicks and frustrates greatly when I scroll using the wrong bar and then have to use the other one (this will reduce with time i'm sure but more experience with the product will not allow me to read anymore words without having to scroll down than i do now	 it will just take away my user errors) . To explain	there is the main vertical scroll bar for the coursera page	 then the secondary one for the embedded OLI textbook. If the OLI textbook opened on a separate tab thus having a wider and deeper reading area and a single vertical scroll bar	 this would greatly enhance readability/usability. My guess is though that doing this would lose its visual link to the Coursera branding. I'd be interested to hear why technically	 this could not be achieved.<br /><br />2. Quizzes within OLI. I have read elsewhere that we can right click and select open in a new window thus answering the issue above	 but we are asked not to do this because we won't be able to complete the pop quizzes throughout the text book. Are these quizzes more for your benefit than ours (confirmation of learning thus confirming the validity of your courseware)? Are you measuring time spent studying within the OLI textbook? For example	 I am so far answering the quizzes at a reasonable percentage	 but it's taking (in my opinion) twice as long to answer because of the usability issues. To explain	 the quizzes are making issue 1 above worse for me as I end up scrolling up each time to reread areas - scrolling. Therefore	 fixing 1 will make issue 2 less of an issue. However	 I still believe that are too many confirmatory questions anyway	 but I will concede that this is a personal feeling related to my own learning style	 i'd be interested to hear feedback from others. I have been through enough software projects to know that users will accept most things if you tell them enough times that nothing can be done about the perceived issue. Let's call it the ""Facebook Factor"" for want of a better term. Not a preferable way of operating though.<br /><br />I hope that the above is understandable and useful feedback. I would be greatly interested to hear feedback from the University and the OLI team on this. To other students: Let me know your feelings on the courseware in relation to usability and it's graphical user interface (bugs aside).&nbsp;<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Phil "

"Here's my experiment - I scored a 22.<br /><br /><div><p><b>THE EFFECT OF POSTED SECURITY PLACARDS ON APARTMENT BUILDING SECURITY</b></p><p>This experiment has been designed around a real-world setting	 specifically the apartment building in which I live in Oakland	 California.</p><p>The lease that each tenant has signed specifically describes the necessity for building security.&nbsp; The single most important part of that security is maintained by the three outside doors remaining shut and locked properly at all times.&nbsp; The tenants can be held responsible in the event of a security issue arising from a tenant failing to keep the doors secured. &nbsp;Despite numerous verbal reminders and warnings from the two resident building managers as well as verbal reminders between the tenants themselves	 the door security is often compromised and the doors are found closed but unlatched	 and can therefore be pulled open from the outside without the need for a key. There have been several occasions where unauthorized persons have entered the building due to the unsecured doors	 e.g. homeless people who have entered and then gone knocking door-to-door asking for money. &nbsp;These types of events have caused great concern for many tenants as well as the resident managers who see a general apathetic attitude towards door security despite repeated verbal reminders. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The question I raise is this: &nbsp;Will placement of&nbsp;<b><i>visual</i></b>&nbsp;security placards on the doors be more effective for improving building security than the existing verbal reminders? &nbsp;My hypothesis is that installing the placards will improve building security as measured by the indicators described below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are the specifics of the building itself	 the tenant population	 and other specific operational parameters:</p><p>1.&nbsp; The building consists of thirty-three (33) apartments	 each of which has a door that opens into common hallways.</p><p>2. &nbsp;There are three doors that serve as the methods of entry and exit to and from the building from the common hallways.</p><p>3. &nbsp;Those three doors swing from the inside to the outside and are unlocked from the inside.</p><p>4. &nbsp;The doors are locked from the outside and one needs a key to open them from the outside.</p><p>5. &nbsp;The doors have spring-loaded automatic closure mechanisms.</p><p>6. &nbsp;The doors sometimes fail to close and latch properly due to poor maintenance of the doors	 their frames	 and of the mechanical insufficiency of the closure mechanisms described above.</p><p>7. &nbsp;The independent variable will be the placement of security reminder placards on the doors that read: &nbsp;&nbsp;""THIS DOOR MUST BE CLOSED AND LOCKED AT ALL TIMES"".</p><p>8. &nbsp;The dependent variable will be the â€œdoor security quotientâ€ as defined below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The experiment will have two groups: &nbsp;the test group	 and the control group.&nbsp; Both will consist of the same population	 specifically the existent tenant population.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Confounding of the dependent variable will be kept to a minimum by means of the following:</p><p>1. &nbsp;There is very little change in tenancy	 if any	 over the period of two weeks	 which is the full time-span of the experiment	 i.e.	 the tenant population will not change.</p><p>2. &nbsp;The tenants will not be told of the experiment underway which might lead them to be more diligent as far as keeping the doors closed and locked.</p><p>3. &nbsp;Any further verbal reminders from the building managers might also skew the dependent variable.&nbsp; Therefore the building managers will be informed of the experiment	 their entries and exits to and from the building will be disregarded	 and they will not make any further verbal security reminders for the entire span of the experiment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My experiment will be conducted as follows:</p><p>1. &nbsp;Three small and unobservable cameras will be installed in such a way as to monitor each of the three doors at all times.</p><p>2. &nbsp;The entry and exit activity through those doors will be recorded for a period of one week.</p><p>3. &nbsp;The control group will be observed first	 to determine the existing state of door security.</p><p>4. &nbsp;The security placards will then be placed on both sides of the three doors.</p><p>5. &nbsp;The variable group will then be observed for the same period of time.</p><p>3. &nbsp;I will then review the recordings	 counting every instance of the doors being opened	&nbsp;the doors closing insecurely	 and&nbsp;the doors closing or being closed securely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It will easily be determined by these counts how secure the doors are by the following calculation: &nbsp;number of times a door closes securely / number of times a door is opened = door security quotient. &nbsp;A perfect (most secure) door security quotient is one (1) - anything lower than one will be seen as a state of lower security. &nbsp;A few hypothetical examples of this calculation can be seen in the following table:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><table>

"That's interesting	 well spotted. I had a look &amp; unit 17 on 'consciousness'&nbsp;isn't included either which also looks interesting with topics such as sleeping and dreaming. But	 I guess they can't include everything in a 12 week course	 so some units have to be dropped. "
"I really like the course too! When I first watched the info video I loved Dr. Smith's accent; I think it's easy to listen to!&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway	 I just wanted to join in and say that I'm happy to be here as well :) "
The problem summary: I have no internet access and could not evaluate my classmates papers please do not deduct because of this. please contact me right away 
"I am starting to feel worried... I am not taking notes at all. Most of the information is in the OLI text and I consider video as a a help to understand that information. For instance	 I think that Prof. Smith tell us about his experinces is very helpful.<br /> "
Yeah I figured the question was inappropriate to ask but I wanted to know the explanation to the answer. Perhaps the way the question was phrased was too vague. 
"I'm a little bit confused now. I thought writing assignment 1 was clear enough	 yet I was unable to include all information required in my assignment. Now writing assignment 2 seems even more confusing	 and I'm afraid that I will lose more points. So can anyone help me with the structure for this assignment? What are the requirements? "
"I am wondering too	 because I am not very good at english	 so if we will write some essay or something	 it will be fun :).&nbsp;<br />But I hope it would be considered ;). "
"<span>
<br />I have similiar case:<br />&nbsp;</span><pre><code><span>According to previous social conformity experiments and hypothesis (eg Asch	 Milgram	 Sherif)	 high number of people should cause a&nbsp;</span><i>diffusion of responsibility</i>	 in my experiment	 this should lead to low numbers in &lt;15 min in high category and high numbers in &gt;30 min category. </code><span>But as my results show	 this was not that case	 in fact	 the more people in an aisle	 the faster was the item picked up	 so there should be a slightly negative correlation (althought 5 tryouts in medium category show &gt;30 minutes delay; I suppose	 that there is some ""breaking point""	 that changes the situation).</span></pre><div><div>The student should have a research hypothesis (prediction of outcome).<br /></div></div><div><p>Score from your peers:&nbsp;<b>1.5</b></p><p><b><br /></b></p></div>Seems legit... "
"I only got 2 out of 15 from my 2nd peer assessment	 and 16 out of 23 from my 1st peer assessment. After i count my final score	 I got 66.94 from the minimum score 70. If there is no change for the scoring system	 then I will fail this course :( "
I need to get assistance from STAFF cause did not have internet cause of technical problems and then I could not evaluate my classmates until it got fixed Monday and now I got Penalized. &nbsp;Please contact me and get back to me about this. 
"About all it was posted before: evaluating is not about searching for the EXACT work requested in the assignment rubric	 but for the actual MEANING of what it was written. So I graded ""O"" if the student said ""There are IVs and DVs"" but did not make them explicit at all	 or if he/she just retold another experiment done by someone else. And I gave a 5 if the IV or DV was defined	 not explicitly called that	 but&nbsp;manipulated&nbsp;and so on	 and I understood from the whole assignment that the student knew was he/she was writing. It's about reading also between the lines	 not being a computer scoring...(I cited the Anonymous!!!!!!) If this is cheating	 sorry. It's just not my manner of evaluating... "
"<p>Hello Friends	 due to a bronchitis it is impossible to attend our meeting Plan&#39;Ä±ndan tomorrow at Aksanat. Shall we postpone to next Saturday? What are your suggestions? Best regards</p>
 "
"I too think that even though it may seem a good idea	 peer review is open to irregular	 non-ubiform	 biased grading of another student's work. Students come from so many different cultural	 ethnic	 academic and religious backgrounds; English may not be their first language	 and as such	&nbsp; some may have difficulty even understabding the course materials. This certainly is not fair; unless of course if peer review marks are reviewed by the academic team. (Then again	 highly unlikely) And 40% is too much to risk.. 20% I may be comfortable with.<br /> "

MUSIC is not tangible. You canâ€™t eat it	 drink it or 
mate with it. It doesnâ€™t protect against the rain	 wind or cold. It doesnâ€™t 
vanquish predators or mend broken bones. And yet humans have always prized music 
â€” or well beyond prized	 loved it. 
In the modern age we spend great sums of money to 
attend concerts	 download music files	 play instruments and listen to our 
favorite artists whether weâ€™re in a subway or salon. But even in Paleolithic 
times	 people invested significant time and effort to create music	 as the <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7256/full/natureZIPCODE.html"" target="""">discovery 
of flutes</a> carved from animal bones would suggest. 
So why does this thingless â€œthingâ€ â€” at its core	 a 
mere sequence of sounds â€” hold such potentially enormous intrinsic value? 
The quick and easy explanation is that music brings a 
unique pleasure to humans. Of course	 that still leaves the question of why. But 
for that	 neuroscience is starting to provide some answers. 
More than a decade ago	 our research team used brain 
imaging to <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/98/20/11818.full"" target="""">show</a> that 
music that people described as highly emotional engaged the reward system deep 
in their brains â€” activating subcortical nuclei known to be important in reward	 
motivation and emotion. <a href=""http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n2/full/nn.2726.html"" target="""">Subsequently</a> 
we found that listening to what might be called â€œpeak emotional momentsâ€ in 
music â€” that moment when you feel a â€œchillâ€ of pleasure to a musical passage â€” 
causes the release of the neurotransmitter <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/science/27angier.html?_r=0"" target="""">dopamine</a>	 
an essential signaling molecule in the brain. 
When pleasurable music is heard	 dopamine is released 
in the striatum â€” an ancient part of the brain found in other vertebrates as 
well â€” which is known to respond to naturally rewarding stimuli like food and 
sex and which is artificially targeted by drugs like cocaine and amphetamine. 

But what may be most interesting here is <i>when 
</i>this neurotransmitter is released: not only when the music rises to a peak 
emotional moment	 but also several seconds before	 during what we might call the 
anticipation phase. 
The idea that reward is partly related to anticipation 
(or the prediction of a desired outcome) has a long history in neuroscience. 
Making good predictions about the outcome of oneâ€™s actions would seem to be 
essential in the context of survival	 after all. And dopamine neurons	 both in 
humans and other animals	 play a role in recording which of our predictions turn 
out to be correct. 
To dig deeper into how music engages the brainâ€™s 
reward system	 we designed a <a href=""http://www.zlab.mcgill.ca/supplements/science_2013.php?1PHONENUM7"" target="""">study</a> 
to mimic online music purchasing. Our goal was to determine what goes on in the 
brain when someone hears a new piece of music and decides he likes it enough to 
buy it. 
We used music-recommendation programs to customize the 
selections to our listenersâ€™ preferences	 which turned out to be indie and 
electronic music	 matching Montrealâ€™s hip music scene. And we found that neural 
activity within the striatum â€” the reward-related structure â€” was directly 
proportional to the amount of money people were willing to spend. 
But more interesting still was the cross talk between 
this structure and the auditory cortex	 which also increased for songs that were 
ultimately purchased compared with those that were not. 
Why the auditory cortex? Some 50 years ago	 Wilder 
Penfield	 the famed neurosurgeon and the <a href=""http://www.mni.mcgill.ca/about/notable/"" target="""">founder</a> of the Montreal 
Neurological Institute	 reported that when neurosurgical patients received 
electrical stimulation to the auditory cortex while they were awake	 they would 
sometimes report hearing music. Dr. Penfieldâ€™s observations	 along with those of 
many others	 suggest that musical information is likely to be represented in 
these brain regions. 
The auditory cortex is also active when we imagine a 
tune: think of the first four notes of Beethovenâ€™s Fifth Symphony â€” your cortex 
is abuzz! This ability allows us not only to experience music even when itâ€™s 
physically absent	 but also to invent new compositions and to reimagine how a 
piece might sound with a different tempo or instrumentation. 
We also know that these areas of the brain encode the 
abstract relationships between sounds â€” for instance	 the particular sound 
pattern that makes a major chord major	 regardless of the key or instrument. 
Other studies show distinctive neural responses from similar regions when there 
is an unexpected break in a repetitive pattern of sounds	 or in a chord 
progression. This is akin to what happens if you hear someone play a wrong note 
â€” easily noticeable even in an unfamiliar piece of music. 
These cortical circuits allow us to make predictions 
about coming events on the basis of past events. They are thought to accumulate 
musical information over our lifetime	 creating templates of the statistical 
regularities that are present in the music of our culture and enabling us to 
understand the music we hear in relation to our stored mental representations of 
the music weâ€™ve heard. 
So each act of listening to music may be thought of as 
both recapitulating the past and predicting the future. When we listen to music	 
these brain networks actively create expectations based on our stored knowledge. 

Composers and performers intuitively understand this: 
they manipulate these prediction mechanisms to give us what we want â€” or to 
surprise us	 perhaps even with something better. 
In the cross talk between our cortical systems	 which 
analyze patterns and yield expectations	 and our ancient reward and motivational 
systems	 may lie the answer to the question: does a particular piece of music 
move us? 
When that answer is yes	 there is little â€” in those 
moments of listening	 at least â€” that we value more.

Great idea i think that is what we are required to 
Thank you. 40 000 is less than I was expecting 
"Hi everyone! My name's NAME2439462 and I'm an Australian currently living in London. I'm currently undertaking studies in counselling skills and I run an online retail business from home. I wanted to do this course as my husband and I will be returning to Melbourne in September so that I can begin a post-graduate degree in psychology. I haven't studied any psychology subjects before and as such	 I'm hoping this course will provide me with a solid introduction to psychology before starting my post-graduate studies in September. "
"I don't have any idea of how is a peer assessment	 never done one	 i just understood we write some work and others grade it	 right? Well	 in my point of view all we here are doing that	 writing and having our posts graded by others	 as we post we are doing a ""peer assessment"".<br />Who posted here had the free-will to post or not	 we know our posts are being subject of a grade (not for the course :P with the arrows up and down) but we did post	 we did it already	 and some did it not just once	 so	 well	 keep practicing :)<br />I would like to focus that what is evaluated here or in the peer assessments is not us	 <b>we are not being evaluated</b> by our&nbsp;colleagues	 our writings are	 not us as persons.<br />Also	 the&nbsp;purpose of evaluation is to keep us learning better and not to judge us. I&nbsp;guess&nbsp;the problem is not what is the best evaluation method as I believe they know what they are doing and they keep researching on it	 I&nbsp;guess&nbsp;the problem is the anxiety of something to come and that keeps us making arguments to avoid it.<br />well	 what is the worst scenario possible? "
"No	 you are wrong bro. There was no separate quiz for week 12 and in the annoucements is written that the first ten questions of the final exam have to be considered as the quiz for week 12. This is also a sound argument for the following reasons: (a) the first 10 questions concerned the week 12 readings/lecture and (b) the few last questions were also (!) regarding the week 12 lectures/readings. So	 my question is: is it logical or even fair to have a relative high frequency of week 12 questions in the final exam?<br /><br />I don't think so. So	 it is valid to argue that the final exam has to be separated in two parts: q1-q10 are considered as quiz 12 and q11-q35 are to be considered as final exam questions.<br /><br />My point doesn't contradict the grading policy or grading calculations	 since the final exam is still weighted for 30% as is the grand total of the quiz scores.<br /><br />In your opinion you have to incorporate the scores of q1-q10 in the final exam. They weight than in the end score for the grading as 10/35 x 0.3. That is unfair since every quiz (1-11) weight only for 1/11 x 0.3. So why should the last quiz (week 12) be weighted approximately 3 times more than a normal quiz?<br /><br />So	 to give an answer to your question: I am not kidding? Are you	 or do you just don't understand mathematics? <br /> "

<p>â€˜Innate predispositionâ€™ finds no mention in OLI or lectures.
Hence that should be the correct answer. The only exception I can think of is
this: &nbsp;â€˜Innate predispositionâ€™ is to be
thought of as synonymous with â€˜geneticsâ€™. Please clarify.</p> "

"I've completed evaluating 3 assignments	 2 of them are good	 well-prepared; but one assignment is really really bad. I think the student wrote this in only 5 minutes	 as it contains only 7 lines with about 100 words	 no originality	 no clear definition of independent and dependent variable	 even no hypothesis. Thus	 I gave this one a really low grade	 and I need a place to tell him/her why his/her grade is so low. On the other hand	 I also have something to comment on the 2 good assignments	 but I did not see the comment box anywhere. So how can I write my opinion? Is it possible? If not	 can the staff add a comment box? I think many people want to give comments on the assignments	 and these comments may be valuable too. "

"EMAIL4745 Totally agree with the cooking analogy<br /><br EMAIL8382 have to correct you on a few points here about the ""experiments"" you saw. I saw a paper that scored a three on the rubric only because I was generous with a last sentence that mentioned trauma having harmful effects as a measure of behavior. I have found that students have written things but they are categorically not experiments. They are studies of various descriptions.<br /><br />I was not looking for a passing mark in this course I wanted the grade I deserve from careful assessment by my peers guided by a rubic befitiing a university level course	 The proff explained all these therms during the lecture so shouldn't be absolutely necessary but if the rubric had explained what a dependent and independent 
variable was etc. I would have been more satisfied	 In Addition	 this would have allowed the intelligent pupils to 
decide on the subtle nuances of the proposed research. Regurgitation of concepts is not a trait of higher education	 that will have ended somewhat in high school.<br /><br />P.S. I wish there was a a comments section so that I could maybe help out a fellow pupil but this is ridiculous. I was forced to give the paper a 3 instead of the 0 it deserves because I can't explain anything to the peer involved. She had in fact written a case study of a traumatic event in her past which whilst moving was not relevant in this context.<br /> "
"Hello! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently completed another Coursera course and I was not sent a certificate of accomplishment	 either through physical or electronic mail. Instead	 when I logged into my Course Dashboard	 the certificate was listed there alongside the course name (and under my Course Records as well) along with my final grade	 and this all showed up two days after the course officially ended. I wish it was at least e-mailed to me so I could keep it on my computer since the PDF file was restricted as well	 so I couldn't save it. The only option was to print	 which is fine	 but I also would prefer to keep it on my computer. Hopefully they will remedy this issue with this course! So	 I'm not 100% certain how they're going to do things with this course	 but my safest bet is that it will be done in a very similar manner as with the other course.

Through an unintentional observation	 I noticed my anxiety do not reflect in my dreams. Several of my friends with anxiety disorder observed the same phenomenal in their dreams too. I would like to take my finding further using tools that will provide the actual data of my basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Research Question:</b>&nbsp;Does the frontal lobe affect most of the anxiety symptoms?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Empirical Study:</b>&nbsp;This experiment needs 20 volunteers diagnosed with different anxiety disorders	 20 volunteers checked and not diagnosed with anxiety disorder	 an fMRI machine and an EEG machine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Independent Variable: Tests for the volunteers</p><p>Dependent Variable: Their anxiety/anxious levels</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This would be a quasi-experiment as the tasks each group will take are controlled. Volunteers will be placed into situations that will make them anxious or trigger their anxiety. Volunteers will also have to be above 18 as alcohol consumption is required. Before the experiment starts	 volunteers will be briefed about the experiment	 if they are uncomfortable with it	 they can opt out at any moment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The experiment will be carried out in 3 stages.</p><p>1st&nbsp;Stage:</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>20 volunteers without anxiety disorder</b>&nbsp;will be placed into the fMRI with&nbsp;<b>situations that will make them anxious</b>&nbsp;while they are&nbsp;<b>awake</b></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>20 volunteers with anxiety disorder</b>&nbsp;will be placed into the fMRI with their&nbsp;<b>anxiety triggers</b>&nbsp;while they are&nbsp;<b>awake</b></p><p>2nd&nbsp;Stage:</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>All the 40 volunteers&nbsp;</b>will be placed into the fMRI when they have fallen asleep&nbsp;<b>till their REM sleep is over</b></p><p>3rd&nbsp;Stage:</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>20 volunteers without anxiety disorder</b>&nbsp;will consume alcohol and be placed into the fMRI with&nbsp;<b>situations that will make them anxious</b>&nbsp;when they are&nbsp;<b>tipsy</b></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>20 volunteers with anxiety disorder</b>&nbsp;will consume alcohol and be placed into the fMRI with their&nbsp;<b>anxiety triggers</b>&nbsp;when they are&nbsp;<b>tipsy</b></p><p>Previous studies have shown that the frontal lobe is inactive during sleep; the frontal lobe is also less active when alcohol is consumed. Stage 2 and 3 are carried out to compare the differences in frontal lobe activities to stage 1. Stage 3 was brought in to back up the results from stage 2 as being tipsy is the least harmful and closest way to being asleep.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Firstly	</b>&nbsp;the 20 volunteers without anxiety disorder will be placed into the fMRI while they are awake. They will be put through an IQ test with a total of 40 questions. The instruction of the IQ test is to â€œAnswer each question to the best of your capabilityâ€. The volunteers will not be notified if the test is timed or not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For the first 20 questions	 volunteers can take as much time as they need to answer each question. For the subsequent 20 questions	 each question has a 30 seconds limit	 a small countdown timer will appear on the screen to notify volunteers of the time they have left to answer each question	 when they reach the last 5 seconds to answer a question	 a voice can be heard counting down the seconds from 5 to 1. On the 21st&nbsp;question	 volunteers will be interrupted with a message telling them â€œYou have now 30 seconds to answer each question.â€</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Check the fMRI machine and note the changes in each volunteerâ€™s brain activities	 mainly the brain activities before the test started	 during the first 20 questions of the IQ test and the last 20 questions of the IQ test. Ask the volunteers about their emotions changes during the different states of the experiment and compare it with the fMRI results.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Secondly	</b>&nbsp;the 20 volunteers with anxiety disorder need to be interviewed and asked about their anxiety triggers	 what triggers affect their anxiety more than the others. Compile a list of the volunteersâ€™ anxiety triggers	 a minimum of 10 triggers is required	 and arrange them based on the severity of the triggers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The 20 volunteers with anxiety disorder will be placed into the fMRI while they are awake. For the first three minutes in the fMRI	 they will be shown a non-anxiety triggering image with smoothing atmospheric music in the background. For the next three minutes	 the music will fade out and they will be shown a visual representation of one of their five most severe anxiety triggers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Check the fMRI machine and note the changes in each volunteerâ€™s brain activities	 mainly the brain activities before the test started	 during the first three minutes and the next three minutes. Ask the volunteers about their anxiety levels during the different parts of the experiment and compare it with the fMRI results.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Thirdly	</b>&nbsp;all the 40 volunteers will be asked to sleep 6 hours the night before the experiment. To make it even easier for the volunteers to fall asleep during the experiment	 the experiment will take place at night	 after the volunteers have been awake for 16 hours. Attach the EEG machine to the volunteers before they prepare to fall asleep. When the EEG waves change from alpha waves to theta rhythm signaling that the volunteer has fallen into stage N1 of NREM sleep	 detach the EEG from them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The volunteers will then be pushed quietly into the fMRI machine 20 minutes after they had drifted into stage N1 of NREM sleep. Note the changes in the fMRI machine regularly to keep track if they had shifted from NREM sleep to REM sleep. It takes approximately 90 minutes of NREM sleep before a person will enter REM sleep. If increase in the cerebral blood flow is detected on the fMRI	 it means the volunteer has entered REM sleep. Wake the volunteer up when their cerebral blood flow decrease to a NREM sleep.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note the changes in each volunteerâ€™s brain activities as they sleep. Ask the volunteers to jot down any dreams they can recall	 at least a line or two is required from each volunteer. If the volunteers are too tired to remember the rest of the dream details	 let them withdraw from the experiment and have a good nightâ€™s sleep. When they wake up the next morning	 prompt them to recall for further details of the dreams they had written and add on any additional dreams they can remember	 including the dreams they had after the experiment. If the volunteers did not remember any dream	 they need to retake the experiment again till they can remember their dream(s). There will be some cases where certain volunteers will have massive difficulty in remembering their dreams	 if thatâ€™s the case	 a new volunteer might be needed to replace them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After the 40 volunteers have jot down all their dreams from the night	 ask them about their feelings in their dreams	 whether they experience anxiety in their dreams and compare it with the fMRI results.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Fourthly	</b>&nbsp;the 20 volunteers without anxiety disorder and 20 volunteers with anxiety disorder will take in as much alcohol as they need to get tipsy but not drunk. A check on their motor coordination will be taken to see if they are tipsy. The volunteers will be asked to string beads on a shoelace. If they are seen having difficulties stringing the beads	 they are most probably tipsy. Verify with the volunteers if they are truly tipsy. There might be cases where some volunteers have difficulty getting tipsy	 if thatâ€™s the case	 a new volunteer might be needed to replace them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For the 20 volunteers without anxiety disorder	 place them into the fMRI when they are tipsy and have them take a psychometric test with the same format as the previous IQ test. For the 20 volunteers with anxiety disorder	 place them into the fMRI machine when they are tipsy and do the same test to them when they were awake.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Check the fMRI machine and note the changes in each volunteerâ€™s brain activities	 mainly the brain activities before and during the experiment.

"After my further consideration	 I came to a conclusion that the experiment I need to assess might be more complicated than I thought. As far as I understand	 there are two different independent variables being manipulated (having two separate control groups). The hypothesis is defined as a statement that there is little difference between dependent variables caused by these two independent variables. At the same time	 the difference between dependent variables caused by manipulation of one of these independent variables is somehow assumed (as supported by other experiments).<br /><br />I am wondering whether this kind of hypothesis may be deemed as ""null"" (predicting no difference). <br /><br />I believe that the same goal of the experiment could be defined in a different hypothesis having the same meaning but without having a problem of nullity. For instance	 ""variable B (second independent variable) causes Variable (dependent variable) almost at the same level as variable A (first independent variable) causes Variable (dependent variable)"". Having said this	 my intuition is that the hypothesis in the experiment I need to assess is not null.&nbsp;<br /><br />Any thoughts?<br /><br />P.S. Sorry for being obscure as I am trying to avoid specifics of the experiment. &nbsp; "

"We received a little more information; that is a good thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />But to tell people who feel that their paper was graded incorrectly that there is nothing that can be done is detrimental to the learning process.&nbsp; UNIVERSITY has taken the meaning out of the assignments not just for those who feel their paper was slighted by hostile or ignorant &nbsp;graders but for everyone.&nbsp; How do I know that the perfect score I received is truly deserved or of there was something that I missed and the paper was graded incorrectly.&nbsp; Since there is no way to tell whether the grade was deserved	 the assignment becomes meaningless.&nbsp; <br /><br />At least in the Irrational Thinking class	 the instructor realized the faults of peer grading in that session&nbsp;and made an adjustment to the grading system so that some of those that lost at the ""game of peer grading"" could recover from some of the damage done to their overall grade.&nbsp; The acknowledgment that the peer assessment process is flawed by the instructor was enough to make some students feel better even though there was no justice presented.&nbsp; To say that addressing the issue takes too much time	 is the same as saying the student's work is not important.&nbsp; <br /><br />My opinion of UNIVERSITY is not a good one.&nbsp; I don't blame Coursera's use of peer assessments because other classes in Coursera that had similar issues handled them through discussions; UNIVERSITY seems to have ""shut-down"" in the face of adversity.&nbsp; They stopped communicating and left the students feeling abandoned.&nbsp; "

"Hello	 classmates!<br /><br />I'm joining three weeks into the course and am eagerly playing catch up with the reading material and videos. I look forward to conversing with you about our class in the upcoming weeks.&nbsp;<br /><br />Best of luck to us all and happy studying!&nbsp; "
"Although english is not my mother tongue	 I think my english is rather good. My whole education (master in chemistry)was given in english and most exams had to be done in english too. <br />Even so	 I found some parts rather difficult since each scientific field uses its own vocabulary I noticed some of the questions in the exam needed translation for me.<br /><br />Honestly	 I think Fernanda has a good point that many of the course participants will face a language barrier.<br />Does this mean solely that a second chance is in order? Not solely. From the start	 we all knew the whole course would de (done) in english...<br />In normal university settings (in Holland that is) a second shot at an exam is totally up to the course professor. Although rare	 some professors will make you wait for the next year. But most of the time a second shot at the exam is granted.<br /><br />Since this is my first course here at Coursera	 I have no idea what the general rule is regarding a second test. I think it would be fair but general guidelines should be followed. It would all be up to professor Smith. "
"Well	 I'll try to explain it as simple as possible (this null hypothesis testing thing is hard to understand	 really). <br />I have a research hypothesis that predicts that something WILL happen with my manipulation. When you test for significance you can test it against the null hypothesis. The null predicts that something WILL NOT happen with my manipulation. You collect the data and if the probability of collecting the data if the null was true is less than 0.05 (5%)	 they you reject the null. It means that your manipulation produced the results that are unlikely if the null is true	 meaning that there is something statistically significant going on once I introduced my manipulation. I reject the null if p (probability) is less than 0.05 and that supports my hypothesis.<br /><br />On the other hand	 let's say that I collect the data	 test it against the null and get a p (probability) of about 0.1 (10%). I have to retain the null and that means that my results are not statistically significant	 for whatever reason. Maybe my experiment was poorly designed	 maybe my independent variable is not a causal factor for an observed behavior	 etc.<br /><br />I tried to explain this the best I could in as little words as possible.<br /> "

"Since I was about fifteen I have been interested in dream studies and as an amateur have developed a knack for it over a life-time.  Within my community I have developed a very positive reputation for this among my small circle of friends and acquaintances and consequently find myself doing a reasonable amount of analysis for free and un-licenced.  Honestly I enjoy it and I try to make clear the fact that I have no academic credentials and that competent therapy is possibly wanted in order to help process some of the dream content that is revealed.  

Yet I have a thirst at this time to re-enter school and as well	 to dig a lot deeper into the sciences of the mind.  It's a natural and life-long interest	 so here I am.  Ultimately I am planing to pursue a psychology degree. "
"Guys	 I've evaluated 3 papers which really were terrible. Two of them not even discussed or even mentioned the debate at hand.

Mainly	 I'm interested in what makes people act the way they do. Is it chemical/biological	 is it social. Is it because of bad examples in the real world. There are so many options out there	 and while I've taken many courses from here on the subject (sub-subjects) I find this one to be the most challenging	 and I really like that. However	 I'm also finding that what I'm learning here is making it much easier to understand for example the ADHD course I'm taking as well. Together they are really answering a lot a questions for me. As for the video lectures	 Dr. Smith is the second best orator I have experienced yet	 (the best was Professor Cockell in the Astrobiology course). Professor Smith has a very engaging voice	 and demeanor	 he cuts to the chase with the material and explains things in a normal language that you can understand. Some people of high intelligence tend to use words they are accustomed to using	 but which many people may not be comfortable with. The professor is careful not to do that and I'm sure many here appreciate that	 I know I do.<br /><br />I look forward to reading what you all think are positive things about this course. <br /> "
Hello! My name is NAME2917218 and I am from Russia. I am currently studying linguistics in Sweden and hope to be doing MSc in Speech and Language Pathology (SLP) soon. I believe this course will be of much help to me in my future pursuits as a SLP. Looking forward to the course! 
"yes	 I do :-)<br /> "
You will definitely find Yerkes in the video lecture.&nbsp; Check it<br /><br /> 
"I think there are other threads about this with different solutions	 but for me what worked was zooming out. Hope that works for you! "
Hola:<br />HabÃ©is creado ya el grupo en facebook??<br /><br /> 
I would like to know the format of the Final Exam. Will all the 35 questions be multiple choice questions or can we expect essay type ones too?&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /> 
"Well guys	 I think this is exactly what the imaginary experiment is all about: to draw the outline	 to use all the principals and terminology we've learned so far (e.g. hypothesis	 publication	 measuring and so on). So it's not important if the experiment itself is true or can be verified	 but as to the steps one must take for a successful experiment!&nbsp; "
"So	 the cycle repeats itself. Thoughts create Feelings	 Feelings create Behavior	 Behavior reinforces Thoughts. Why doesn't Behavior reinforces Feelings?! When we behave in a certain way or chose to behave in some doesn't our behavior create feelings? "
"To get one thing clear	 your whole thread is an implied threat	 starting with your title	 ""Peer Assessment - Illegal"" to the first sentence in your first post	 ""It seems that the absolute requirement for peer assessment could violate
 various parts of the Americans With Disabilities Act since it may 
needlessly disadvantage people with certain conditions such as social 
anxiety	 anxiety disorders	 avoidant personality disorder etc."" Your comments continue to imply that this is illegal and should be stopped. That is an implied threat! You may think you know the law	 but quoting it and getting it are 2 different things. BTW it's only libel if it's not true. <br /><br />~ Part-time legal secretary from 2000-2010 :-) <br /> "
"The problem summary:<br />There was some &nbsp;problem with the system while I have been attempting to submit my final examination quiz for quite some time before the hard deadline. This was (with score 30/35) finally shown by the system to have been submitted at 5:00 pm EDT on Sunday	 June 23&nbsp;&nbsp;(deadline time) but not acceted.&nbsp;As a result	 I fail with 66% instead of distinction with 91.9%	 had the system accepted my submission. I wonder why it happened &amp; I fail instead of distinction.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> "
"I just wanted to thank everyone involved about the OLI textbook - I've just finished first eight modules	 and I ALREADY feel that I have a better understanding of the history of psychology/brain structure/nervous system/neurons than through all high school biology classes and my previous reading &nbsp;(of popular science magazines) COMBINED! <br /><br />Content and time-wise this course is challenging me to the limits (I don't really have much time to devote to this course per week)	 I came here expecting just an easy introduction to psychology - but instead I found myself studying individually for hours on the subject matters I never imagined studying in such a depth in an introductory course. &nbsp;But the best thing about the experience: even though there are so many facts that I didn't know previously	 the textbook organizes them in such a way that it is actually FUN TO LEARN! All those tests	 and double tests	 and dragging information here and there have allowed me to learn so much in a very short amount of time that I never before considered possible. This seems to be THE method for future learning. Information really sticks in memory	 it's beyond what I knew previously	 and in addition to that I do not see all that wealth of facts as&nbsp;a burden. It's more like a very educative game!&nbsp;<br /><br />That textbook is a miracle	 real miracle. Thank you so much for it! "

I &nbsp;just had the same problem. 
"Good luck to everyone. Hopefully we'll be more elastic with each others marking	 this time... "
"Perhaps i'm being too ""technical""	 but as a physicist I find some of the questions a bit confusing and having different meanings	&nbsp;e.g.<br /><br />* ""<span>Some people donâ€™t dream."" is	 indeed	 true. Dead people can't dream.<br />* ""</span><span>Opposite types of people attract each other"": all people do attract each other gravitationally.<br /><br />Some previous questions concerning the anatomy of the eye suggest a more ""precise"" answer than the questions above and answering them in the beginning of the test ""sets the tone"" for the rest of the answers	 rendering some of them incorrect.<br /><br />PS I am watching the first lecture now	 if this thread seems stupid to me after doing that	 i'll delete it.</span> "
"Khaos W.	<br /><br />My perception is that the <b>""Sample"" in relation to the ""Population"" </b>has to be mentioned.<br /><br />Instead of using that statistical parlance	 <b>""the number of participants"" in plain language </b>is used so that most of the students can understand it. I have given marks even if the exact numerical figure is not stated but the size of sample is identified with a definite indication. For example	 ""the students of 7th grade in Wordsworth School"" will qualify to be indicative of the number of participants instead of ""some school students of Wordsworth School"".<br /> "
"Hi Leah	<br />I don't think the boy is the US	 I think ""<i>something""&nbsp;</i>(probably all they talk	 the situation	 smiles	 looks	 chemistry	 etc) made her ""fall in love for that boy""	 so the ""<i>something""&nbsp;</i>would be the US and ""fall in love with that boy"" the response UR. Movie would be the CS	 ""fall in love with that boy"" would be the CR.<br />But also there isn't here a repetition but ok	 let's assume because it was so strong doesn't need repetition. So the movie got associated with the ""<i>something</i>""? Or was associated with the feeling of falling in love?<br />There isn't here a ""when X happens then Y also happens (the learning) so I feel in love because X is happening so Y will happen to"". In that case I think the movie was turned into an anchor and not a CS	 do you agree? "
"I submitted my assignment way before it was due	 and now it says that ""no work was submitted""	 yet underneath my entire essay is there&nbsp; "
My understanding is:&nbsp;<br /><br />Behaviour is strengthned (Increase the likelihood of a behaviour) - Reinforcement<br />Add a pleasant Stimulus - Positive<br />Remove an unpleasant Stimulus - Negative<br />Behaviour is weakened ( Decrease the likelihood of a behaviour) - Punishment<br />Add an unpleasant stimulus - Positive<br />Remove a pleasant Stimulus - Negative<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br /><br />

<p>To be an authoritative figure	 you want to be coolly 
scientific. You want to possess an arcane body of technical expertise. You want 
your mind to be a neutral instrument capable of processing complex quantifiable 
data. </p>
<p>The people in the human sciences have tried to 
piggyback on this authority model. For example	 the American Psychiatric 
Association has just released the fifth edition of the Diagnostic Statistical 
Manual of Mental Health Disorders. It is the basic handbook of the field. It 
defines the known mental diseases. It creates stable standards	 so that 
insurance companies can recognize various diagnoses and be comfortable with the 
medications prescribed to treat them. </p>
<p>The recent editions of this manual exude an impressive 
aura of scientific authority. They treat mental diseases like diseases of the 
heart and liver. They leave the impression that you should go to your 
psychiatrist because she has a vast body of technical knowledge that will allow 
her to solve your problems. With their austere neutrality	 they leave a distinct 
impression: Psychiatrists are methodically treating symptoms	 not people. </p>
<p>The problem is that the behavorial sciences like 
psychiatry are not really sciences; they are semi-sciences. The underlying 
reality they describe is just not as regularized as the underlying reality of	 
say	 a solar system. </p>
<p>As the handbookâ€™s many critics have noted	 
psychiatrists use terms like â€œmental disorderâ€ and â€œnormal behavior	â€ but there 
is no agreement on what these concepts mean. When you look at the definitions 
psychiatrists habitually use to define various ailments	 you see that they 
contain vague words that wouldnâ€™t pass muster in any actual scientific analysis: 
â€œexcessive	â€ â€œbinge	â€ â€œanxious.â€ </p>
<p>Mental diseases are not really understood the way	 
say	 liver diseases are understood	 as a pathology of the body and its tissues 
and cells. Researchers understand the underlying structure of very few mental 
ailments. What psychiatrists call a disease is usually just a label for a group 
of symptoms. As the eminent psychiatrist Allen Frances writes in his book	 
â€œSaving Normal	â€ a word like schizophrenia is a useful construct	 not a disease: 
â€œIt is a description of a particular set of psychiatric problems	 not an 
explanation of their cause.â€ </p>
<p>Furthermore	 psychiatric phenomena are notoriously 
protean in nature. Medicines seem to work but then stop. Because the mind is an 
irregular cosmos	 psychiatry hasnâ€™t been able to make the rapid progress that 
has become normal in physics and biology. As Martin Seligman	 a past president 
of the American Psychological Association	 put it in The Washington Post early 
this year	 â€œI have found that drugs and therapy offer disappointingly little 
additional help for the mentally ill than they did 25 years ago â€” despite 
billions of dollars in funding.â€ </p>
<p>All of this is not to damn people in the mental health 
fields. On the contrary	 they are heroes who alleviate the most elusive of all 
suffering	 even though they are overmatched by the complexity and variability of 
the problems that confront them. I just wish they would portray themselves as 
they really are. Psychiatrists are not heroes of science. They are heroes of 
uncertainty	 using improvisation	 knowledge and artistry to improve peopleâ€™s 
lives. </p>
<p>The field of psychiatry is better in practice than it 
is in theory. The best psychiatrists are not austerely technical	 like the 
official handbookâ€™s approach; they combine technical expertise with personal 
knowledge. They are daring adapters	 perpetually adjusting in ways more 
imaginative than scientific rigor. </p>
<p>The best psychiatrists are not coming up with abstract 
rules that homogenize treatments. They are combining an awareness of common 
patterns with an acute attention to the specific circumstances of a unique human 
being. They certainly are not inventing new diseases in order to medicalize the 
moderate ailments of the worried well. </p>
<p>If the authors of the psychiatry manual want to invent 
a new disease	 they should put Physics Envy in their handbook. The desire to be 
more like the hard sciences has distorted economics	 education	 political 
science	 psychiatry and other behavioral fields. Itâ€™s led practitioners to claim 
more knowledge than they can possibly have. Itâ€™s devalued a certain sort of 
hybrid mentality that is better suited to these realms	 the mentality that has 
one foot in the world of science and one in the liberal arts	 that involves 
bringing multiple vantage points to human behavior. </p>
<p>Hippocrates once observed	 â€œItâ€™s more important to 
know what sort of person has a disease than to know what sort of disease a 
person has.â€ Thatâ€™s certainly true in the behavioral sciences and in policy 
making generally	 though these days it is often a neglected truth.&nbsp;</p></div> "
"When we read up articles on the net	 considering that we can't be sure of their authenticity	 are we expected to give those also as&nbsp; references	 <br />Since we are not doing the experiment	 our report will not have any analysis features. A word count of 1400 seems too much for what we will be writing. Is there a minimum word limit.<br /> "
"I had the same problem with one of the assignments. I marked the student down	 but I didn't grade the work with zero. Somewhere in between...<br /> "
"I have a problem similar to question2. One of the assessments I should evaluate is just the discription of the Bobo Doll experiment. I can't evaluate it bad according to criteria	 but I don't think this ""work"" should have many points. "
"Hmmm... Some of the topics are covered with more questions. What this exam does	 it really tests you on the understanding of the covered material	 e.g. they might ask you something like this: 'if we do this and that	 then what is it?'<br /><br />It might be a good idea to review the tests you've already taken	 they are good refreshers of memory	 at least for me.<br /> "
True. So the self-sarcasm worked. Cheers and thx for the reply. NAME2016639.- 
"Good afternoon Prof. Smith and Sir Alex<br />I would like first to acknowledged how much I learned from the course<br />and from you. Thank you very much!<br />With all due respect	 I have&nbsp; suggestions as to the computation of our grades especially the 2 assignments/ to buffer the average of the 2 grades we have in the assignments. This is some way to help us and all the students taking this course: I'm respectfully suggesting three options only if its alright with your end:<br />1. Can we request for a third assignment to buffer the low grades for the two assignments.<br />2. It was mentioned that our evaluation of other &nbsp;students of their assignments will be part of our grade. Obviously	 its so hard to grade 50	000 or more students.<br />Can we just possibly be given another grade as a third assignment if we complied with the submission of grades.<br />3. Can we just use the median in the computation of &nbsp;the grades for the assignments. I used to do this before when i was a part time assistant professor&nbsp;as a consideration for my students. &nbsp;For the purposes of&nbsp;concerned&nbsp;students	 &nbsp;This is how it goes.&nbsp; The <b>Median</b> is the score that divides the grade curve down the middle (think about the so-called ""median-line"" in the road: ).  Half of the students score at or above the median	 and the other half at or below the mean. <div>In the example above	 if the median of the last assignment was 6 correct out of 15. This means that half of the students scored&nbsp; &nbsp;6 or higher (and the other half score less than 6 )For those of you who are familiar with ""percentiles"" (like on the SAT) the median gives the 50th-percentile score because if i'm not mistaken their passing is 50th percentile.</div><p>The median is another way of judging the class performance	 since the arithmetic mean can be skewed slightly by having a number of very high or very low scores.  If the curve has a long tail towards lower scores	 as it the case here	 then the median is a better measure of class performance than the mean.  If the curve is a symmetric bell curve	 the mean and median are the same. Therefore the passing grade of 70% would be applicable to those who will be getting 6 points and not to those who will be getting 10.5. </p><p>Or we can apply highest minus lowest divided by two to get the passing mark.------This is just a suggestion Sir	 Thank you very much<br /></p> "
"I didn't agree with mine either. My assignment followed and included all steps (and a few extra ones too)	 but I ""only"" had 15. <br /><br />Here is my assessment.<br /><br />Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«<br /><p></p><p><b>READING	 WATCHING	 AND LEARNING EXPERIMENT -&nbsp;WHAT DOES IMPROVE YOUR LEARNING BETTER: READING OR WATCHING?</b>""</p><p><b>1-) BACKGROUND AND REASONS</b></p><p>I remembered this experiment because one of my virtual classmates said she improved her learning better by watching course videos than by reading eg their subtitles or any other reading material (eg pdf files).</p><p><b>2-) EXPERIMENT QUESTION</b></p><p>So	 is this accurate? Does watching really improve learning (or academic performance) at least in some stuents? And	 if the answer is positive for he same students -	 why does this happen? I considered these issues were a good basis for my own psychology experiment</p><p>At first I had two questions:<br />A-) For you	 it's better to improve your own learning by watching a video about a certain subject or by reading about it?<br />B-) Why do you think (please circle ONLY one of the words) READING WATCHING improves your learning?&nbsp;<br />Please give several reasons	 besides trying to explain them.</p><p>But then I reread the assigment task: Â«<i>Be simple</i>.Â»	 before finding the following:&nbsp;<span>Â«<i>If the research is for coursework don't be too ambitious</i>. [...]&nbsp;<i>It is</i>&nbsp;[...]<i>often easier if you have just one research question to investigate - you don't get twice the marks if you have two questions</i>!Â» (2	 p6) So I decided for only one research question:</span></p><p>""<b>Do you improve your learning better by watching a video about a certain subject	 or by reading about it?</b>""</p><p><b>3-) DEVELOPMENT OF HYPOTHESIS THROUGH PREDICTION</b>&nbsp;(a)</p><p>My first guess about what would happen in the experiment is that the majority of its participants would answer they learn more by reading than by watching (eg a video).</p><p>I also have a guess about hobbies: those who love to read would (almost surely) choose reading as the way they would learn better.&nbsp;This guess might also be appliable to people with superior (eg university) academic qualifications.</p><p>Another guess of mine is that participants with ""practical"" academic qualifications and/or jobs (thus needing practical experiences	 like watching someone	 a video	 etc.	 to learn)	 would choose watching	 while people with ""theoretical"" academic qualifications and/or jobs would choose reading instead.</p><p><b>4-) PARTICIPANTS</b></p><p>I would love to have a significative sample of (totally anonymous) participants	 divided according to at least five parameters: age; sex; literary qualifications; hobbies; and profession. But	 since it would be an optional task	 I would be happy enough if I had at least 20 participants.</p><p>Why would the parameters above be important? Eg to check the data in percent about who of them chose reading (or watching) as learning more according their (in alphabetical order): age; hobbies; literary qualifications; job or profession; sex.</p><p>As referred before	 the identity of the participants would be totally anonymous	 except some data to give this experiment (at least) data and tools enough to compare	 and to be be compared.</p><p>I would get participants by asking/inviting them to participate in the forum of a course. The 'questionary' would be available through an online site offering free quizzes.</p><p><b>5-) DEVELPMENT OF STUDY MATERIAL</b></p><p>The study material would be:</p><p>- The question (""<b>Do you improve your learning better by watching a video about a certain subject	 or by reading about it?</b>"")</p><p>- Online tools to: collect the answers; perform/process/show (statistic) results.</p><p>- &nbsp;Some anonymous information about each participant:</p><p>&nbsp; - Sex</p><p>&nbsp; - Age;</p><p>&nbsp; - Hobbies</p><p>&nbsp; - Literary Qualifications</p><p>&nbsp; - Job or Profession</p><p><b>6-) KEY VARIABLES</b></p><p>The Â«<i>independent variables (antecedent conditions whose effects are to be determined)</i>Â» (1	 p75): learning.<br />The dependent variables (Â«<i>the behavior that is measured</i>Â»&nbsp; [1	 p42]): reading or watching.</p><p><b>7-) COLLECT AND ANALYZE DATA	 REPORT	 AND THE RESULTS</b></p><p>All data would then be collected and then performed	 processed	 and showed through an online site offering free quizzes and statistic results.&nbsp;This site should be flexible enough to allow statistical data (in sum	 percent) interpretations and readings about the five parameters pointed above of the (anonymous) participants. That would avoid the development and/or use of specific tools for statistical data. It migh eg show 85% male and 82% female had chosen reading as the most effective way to learn. Of course inferences envolving two or more of the parameters would be available as well. For instance	 89% males and 88 females with university literary qualifications had chosen reading as the most effective way of learning. So	 the scale of measurement used would be the ""direct or positive correlating"" one	 Â«<i>to correlate is to specify the form and the degree of relationship or strenght of association between phenomena</i>.Â» (1	 p16)</p><p>The experiment or study report and its results would be available at the quiz site	 and its link(s) would be included in a thread of this course's forum.</p><p>-----</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>(a) Â«<i>The anticipation of an event prior to its occurrence is prediction</i>.

Quizz 1 is not available yet? or Quizz1 is the pre-test??? 
"You remember the optical illusion of the spinning dancer in our OLI textbook?<br /><br /><a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Spinning_Dancer.gif"" target=""_blank"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Spinning_Dancer.gif</a> <br /><br />The gif which can test whether you're using your left brain or right brain at the moment? If the dancer is spinning clockwise	 you're using your right brain	 if the dancer is spinning anti-clockwise	 you're using your left brain.<br /><br />I decided to bring what we had learn to a whole new level. Our left and right brain specifically control certain areas. In the past I had difficulty seeing the dancer alternating between different&nbsp;directions because I couldn't switch between using my left and right brain and I didn't know how.<br /><br />I tried tapping the left and right side of my brain to switch directions&nbsp;and it worked. Next	 I moved on to moving my left and right arms vigorously and the dancer switched between directions too. I got more ambitious and I wanted to try changing the direction of the dancer just by the thoughts in my head	 I alternate between focusing on my thoughts and feelings	 and doing maths and recalling a happy memory and it all worked! :D<br /><br />After all that	 I was wondering if I could change the direction even faster. I snapped my fingers on my left and right hands to change the direction almost instantly. Then I tried using just my right hand to snap on my left and right side and that worked too. Finally	 I was tapping my left earphone and right earphone to change the directions	 I was trying to associate the direction of the sound to the direction of the dancer.<br /><br />And my conclusion is	 we can easily switch between&nbsp;the usage of our left or right brain any time we want as long as we teach our brain how to do it. Feels like I'm doing classical conditioning to my brain in this way. "

"Personally	 if it is something we learned from the course	 I don't think it would be necessary to quote	 unless of course	 you are writing word for word. Then anything else would be considered plagiarism. However	 if you are using the information you were supposed to learn in the course	 I think it's expected you use that knowledge in your paper. Just my opinion though. Again	 anything copied word for word should have references and even in that case	 one needs to be very careful. In my last course I got a paper where out of 800 words	 the 700 were copied quotes of other peoples work. I gave that a ""0"" especially since the paper was on ""your personal experience"". There is nothing personal in copying someone else's work!&nbsp; <br /> "
"Looking at the assessment criteria	 I feel that some people would have scored better than they deserved. An example would be a student who detailed down every single step in his/her experiment and a student who just briefly wrote about his/her experiment.<br /><br />Because one of the&nbsp;criteria is ""<span>what the subject does from the beginning to the end of the experiment""	 a student who briefly wrote about his/her experiment	 even if it's unclear	 will still receive marks for it because he/she did gave a short summary&nbsp;of the experiment.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<br /><br />Besides that	 I feel that the assessment criteria is pretty much up to us to interpret. There isn't much heads up to tell us what to specifically take note of during marking. I could jolly well just do CTRL + F and search for keywords like ""Independent""	 ""Dependent"" and ""Analyse/Analysis"" without reading their whole experiment to award them marks.<br /><br />I was rather upset that the marking scheme wasn't phrased clearly. I need to re-read the same sentence&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;times before I get what it's saying.<br /><br />And I'm not sure if it's just me but a lot of students submitted a ""Describe an experiment"" paper without describing about their experiment. I was rather surprised when I received short essays giving me only a literature review and a conclusion. Anyway	 that's not quite what I wanted to say. I've noticed some students do not have a good command of English too. It might be because English isn't their first language so I think it's unfair if we marked them based on grammar	 sentence structure	 clarity	 etc. They didn't take an English proficiency test before they started the course so it's unfair to them if we marked them based on their&nbsp;language as they're not prepared for it.<br /><br />Lastly	 I agree that a comment box is highly needed. The comment box doesn't have to be part of the grades	 it can just serve as a communication platform between the marker and the student. At least the student would know why he/she received certain grades and the marker can give the students some opinions about their experiments too. "
All the courses that I have completed include the percentages (grade) on the course records.&nbsp; None of the certificates&nbsp;have that percentage on them.&nbsp; 
"This is a perfect example of Weber's Law at work.<br /><br />A) 10-20 million cells in the olfatory membrane versus 5 million cells in the olfactory bulb.<br />b) 5-10 million cells in the olfactory membrane versus 1&nbsp; million cells in the&nbsp; olfactory bulb.<br /><br /><br />The difference is the same	 but in the first case it passes quite unnoticed (big magnitudes)&nbsp;	 but in the second case is more obvious (smaller magnitudes) "
what was the total number of marks one could get?<br /> 
"Hey Sophie	 I really don't think it will be time	 but let wait and see. "
Yes I think it is a great ideal.

"Mathematical rounding off leads to 100% but since we know something (however miniscule) is beyond 3 SDs	 the logical answer is 99%. I can give you an example. Some softwares about duration of term deposit in bank show a duration of sat 3 years 11 months 30 days instead of 4 years! It depends on the logic fed into the software. I can only say human mind is more accurate. "
Can you learn to be afraid of something or disgusted by something by witnessing someone else's experience? Would this be more like classical conditioning or observational learning? 
I am happy with my score 19&nbsp; 
Got a 23. Very happy! It took me a long time to come up with an idea for an experiment and to then structure it in a way that was clear and concise (and also making sure there were no confounding variables... sneaky little things do not always make themselves obvious!) but it seems like it was time well spent. :)

"Thanks	 Federica for encouragement. I don't give up	 and I don't plan to :-)<br /><br />Meanwhile	 for me ""the American dream"" seems like a magic. Coursera	 helps us to get up	 to learn for free and it's wonderful. <br />But on the other hand	 it shows us young boys and girls who work as TA and seem nice and happy. The only difference between them and us is that they were born in the right place and in the right time. What did they do for that sake? Why them and not us? Why should I try so hard and work for free	 when the only payment I get is the hope (a chance)	 that maybe one day I will be accepted to a real American or UK university. But I have to do it	 because otherwise	 there won't be any chance at all. <br />Why they can go to bars and parties	 when I have to work	 work and work? Moreover	 it's frustrating to be compared to them. They can study all the time they want. They have access to journal	 to Professors	 to books	 companies and databases. I have to work all day to earn for living	 and in the scarce free time I have	 I come to study.

"Sorry forgot to give more details about myself. I have a degree in engineering and MBA. I am a writer	 contributing articles to different websites and magazines for several years. I also write stories	 working on a book of short stories also at present. "
"I have seen that video too	 it's good :)<br />well	 as I can see I give a bad example	 I close 2 times on ""ps"" and on ""m""	 but I'm portuguese	 and my experience with english is only in reading	 not talking	 so... <br />I think I made my point anyway as I was trying to share what I understood. "
Thank you very much!<br /> 
"During the course	 I have copied and pasted every page of OLI Textbook into Word. It took a lot of time to do so but I'm glad I did it from the beginning so now I have a Word version of the OLI Textbook. I converted it into pdf file and here is the link to download:<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ct3dnbjikptm0s/OLI%20-%20Open%20Learning%20Initiative%20Textbook.pdf"" target="""">https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ct3dnbjikptm0s/OLI%20-%20Open%20Learning%20Initiative%20Textbook.pdf</a><br /><br />Alternate link:<br /><a href=""http://www.mediafire.com/download/gf4m9d5xec23oen/OLI_-_Open_Learning_Initiative_Textbook.pdf"" target="""">http://www.mediafire.com/download/gf4m9d5xec23oen/OLI_-_Open_Learning_Initiative_Textbook.pdf</a><br /><br />Notes:<br />- I only copied the content	 so ""learn by doing""	 ""did you get it"" and the post test are not included in the ebook.<br />- There are some footnotes written in my first language (Vietnamese)	 well	 just ignore them :-)&nbsp;<br />- All images	 tables and links to videos are included. References are partly included	 at some time I was too lazy so I decided not to copy references	 but still for many modules	 references are available.<br />- If the download link is not working for you	 please leave a comment.<br />- I do not own the rights to this book	 all credits go to its authors. I just created the e-book for sharing in this class&nbsp;so do not use it for commercial purpose.<br />- To the staff: if the sharing of this book is against the law	 please inform me.<br /> "
"Same here. I am not able to see the scores of the two quizzes. I checked in the ""My Scores"" link. Does anybody else has the same issue? "
"I also see emptiness when I click on ""Go to assignment"" button. Tested in IE10 and Google Chrome - the result is the same. Few days ago I could see other assignments. Apparently something is broken now. "
Thanks so much! 
"Hola from Spain	
my name is Ruxandra NAME1407014	 nice to meet people from my homeland:) Hope will learn a lot and share interesting experiences! "
"Yes	 I think so. I mean	 if you donÂ´t even trust your parents when you are a baby	 you most likely will have trust problems as an adult.<br /><br /><br />I guess this is what happens with teeanage pregnancies. When the mother is too young	 she may feel stressed and donÂ´t show the right emotional skills	 so she can crÃ©ate an insecure or ambilalent attachement	 instead of a secure one. "
"Perfect! I'm joining....
 "
I do not agree that the evaluation is vague.&nbsp; I think we just need to respond in honesty and leave the rest to the calculations.<br /><br /> 
"Hi! I am Shirney NAME2904581 from Malaysia	 a student who are currently enrolling to a psychology programme. The moment I saw this course and I knew that this is my thing. I really like to learn more about psychology! "
"The diagramm (OLI &nbsp;p.85) shows the ratio between different kinds of agressive behavior in two groups.&nbsp;It seems logically to me why the ""Feel"" columns higher than the ""Do/Say"" in both groups	 because people often do not express their whole feelings. However	 the amount of agressive thoughts is fewer than action. How is that possible? Does this mean that they act without thinking what they are doing? "
"You really need at least one professional evaluator. &nbsp;The peers just dont pay attention and in fact they way they grade should be an experiment in itself. &nbsp;(everyone grades one professional paper and standardize their score against that paper.)<br /><br />I got a ""3"" in two sections - one for Hypothesis and one for Analyze. &nbsp;I'm not even joking when I say my assignment starts with ""MY HYPOTHESIS IS"" and then I wrap up with a section titled ""ANALYSIS."" &nbsp;<br /><br />I also lost a point for not having definitions	 when I have a section called definitions and described each of my variables.<br /><br />Fortunately I am not paying for the course	 and this process has soured my appetite to take another at coursera. &nbsp;What a joke. "
&nbsp;My answer to the Q9 was marked as correct. I got 10/10.<br /><br /><br /> 
Very unprofessional!<br /> 
"The task was to write it in English.<br />You can use an automatic translator. If you don't understand some parts	 you can give no points for that. I think it would have been much easier for many peope to write in their native language. But the task was the same for everyone.<br /> "
Thanks so much!! I really hope they send it via e-mail this time.&nbsp;<br /><br />Thanks again for the info!! :D 
I would like to say thank you to Professor Smith for gifting us with such great course with outstanding content and for his dedication and excellent delivery. A course of this quality equivalent to second year of Psychology or even further has been a great opportunity and a joy to participate and to be able to profit from all the knowledge presented here with the quality of a top university but without cost. I would like as well to say thanks to Alex and all the team for their help and patience and also to the &nbsp;UNIVERSITY University. 
"Indeed	 children who learn several languages go through this process slightly slower. <br />Later on	 they tend to abandon one or two languages that are less frequently used at home and major in one or two of them. But if you do continue speaking all the four languages at home	 your son will be fluent in four of them. <br />My kids have 3 native languages. <br /> "
Kindly check the caption about high and low frequency waveform and color. Seems like it is wrong. 
"We have been asked to mention data collection methods but it is not mentioned in the marking questions. All really depend of we call ""discuss""	 To me it is explaining a theory	 on what it i based	 and its limits. Including references. But the essays I corrected are between 150 and 500 words... with a maximum of 3 references.<b> I still marked nicely because it is 0 or 3	 so I turned ""discuss"" into ""mention""</b>. But I am worried for myself	 because even though I dedicated a big part of my essay to genetic	 twin studies and family studies	 I haven't mentioned ""heritability"". Plus I don't debate about ""Culture"" but ""environment"" or ""nurture"" or ""experience"". If people want to mark restrictively I may have a very bad mark	 even if my essay is full of academic debate and experimental results (and 1460 words but long doesn't mean good).<b> If they don't write ""culture"" or ""heredity"" but express claims about the concepts	 I give the point.&nbsp;</b><br /><br /> "
"This appears to be more of an observational study than a proceedure for manipulating behavior. I do not see a prediction (hyposthisis) of what you suspected the independant variable would do to behavior. You were supposed to have two groups	 a control and another group that you manipulated	 to see if you could get a different result. You were not supposed to perform an actual experiment and write about it	 you were supposed to explain how the experimental method would be&nbsp;followed if you were ""writing a proceedure"" to do an experiment. Sorry this is not better news :(<br /> "
"Hello everyone. I've just realized that this course comes slowly to an end. And to be absolutely honest	 I don't want it to end! Never could've thought that I would say so	 but it's true. The course itself by Mr.Anderson	 the lectures and the OLI material&nbsp;are&nbsp;in the majority constructed and presented in a way that to my brain they function like a fairy tale! So everything that would normally seem tough and much harder even to grasp	 I can really understand efficiently. So	 after thanking Mr.Anderson and his team	 I wanted to place a question: Will there be	 sometime	 a part II in this course? Pleeeease! "
Yes I just encountered the same situation.&nbsp; A confirmation test ran in MS Word indicates that it is 100% accurate which indicates the CourseA environment appears to be off.&nbsp; I am anxious to learn if other students have the same issue and to hear back from the instructors. 
MINE TOO please :)<br /><br /> 
"Hi Kemi	<br /><br />The deadline for the quiz is 8 am EDT ( Easter Day light saving time) &nbsp;and you have worked under PDT which is one hr behind eastern time. Please remember all dates/deadlines are set to EDT. This is for your future reference.<br /><br />Better luck next time. Sorry about that!<br /><br /> "
"Salutari:)
Sper ca acest curs sa fie extraordinar de interesant si sa ne satisfaca curiozitatea! "
"Thank you for posting your ideas	 that's really helpful!<br />Anyway	 I don't like that we spend so much time with guessing what the task could mean and speculating for the evaluation criteria :-( "
"Ty Leanne	 I shall make the most of them and I thank you very much. <br /><br /> "
"That's part of life	 it sucks but it's true...opinions are like the tags that brands us! No matter what I say or how I put it	 some body some centuries ago already left a definition for it...opinion...**smile**...It's part of being an individual.<br />. <br />In it all I just wanted the ""rest"" to know I did read all the comments and every single one had a valid point	 EVERY single one. I mean I read and was like ""I didn't know that!"" and ""wow I never think of putting that like this"" or ""Geez well said!"" 	 I was awed every time....I don't see how no one else seeing the beauty of what happened here....I call this little forum here "" The fine arts of ideas"" because for me it was like the greatest mass selections of passionate thoughts and feelings ever put in one place	 like a painting with some of the most rarely displayed but beautiful colors. So what if you are the magenta or turquoise between all the displays it's still you	 still your thoughts and opinions and should be respected and I love along with the passion that goes with it...<br />But at the end of the day	 I don't want anyone making virtual enemies...**sad**....at least not over opinions and ideas. <br /><br />I am just saying you know....<br />Besides	 I am from the Caribbean and live by songs ""don't worry about a thing"" and ""don't worry be happy""....**grin** <br /><br />Life is fun people no matter who you are or what you have...one life you have to live	 so live and love it!...oh unless you believe in the reincarnation theory...which would be so kool because I never did understand it so share!...**hugs**<br /><br /><br /> "
i hvnt receive my letter of accomplishment. please consider it.<br /><br /> 
"Indeed the course material that was available to us	 the help provided and almost everything in this course was really good!<br />I loved it!<br />The only complain I would make is that I do not favor the rubrics. It was the first time I had to deal with them and I think that could be better. At least to give us more options not all or nothing approaches. But nothing is perfect.<br />The good point is that whenever there was a problem Dr Smith and Alex was there to help and to consider the issue (I am referring to the coment box for the second assignment and not only to that).<br />Anyway	 <b>Thank you Dr Smith	 thank you Alex	 thank you coursera	 OLI and everyone that assisted in us having this marvelous course!!!</b><br /> "
"My only complaint with the peer assessment is that it never stated that we needed have a hypothesis. I was considering putting one in	 but I didn't think I needed it because it only told me to ""design an experiment."" Part of the fault is mine for not having been cautious	 but still I would agree with the above complaints that the criteria for evaluation should be told to us<i>&nbsp;</i>before we submit. I understand that the course may be trying to test our ability to create an experiment on our own	 without preset guidelines	 but for those of us who already understand it (it's a basic scientific concept	 after all) its quite stressful to know that we&nbsp;<i>can</i> design an experiment but are losing points because we did not realize that they wanted it done in this particular way. "
hopefully this is true cause i am about to do the week 12 which is the final and was not going to complete the OLI. &nbsp;thanks for confirming.

"Hi	&nbsp;<br />It is good to have a word count as an indication on the expected length of an essay	 but that usually not includes the references. But here it will! And that can be a problem	 specially given that most experiment are conducted by large teams... so a lot of names... and the internet link... so a lot of words....<br />My essay is 1200 words but my references are 500! A solution would be not to follow APA standards (strange in a psychology essay) or to plagiarize... (of course I am not planing to do so).&nbsp;<br />Any better solution? Can we have a extra box for the references? Can I create a hyperlink to an online word document? Does 1500 words just includes the references? "

"Hello everyone!
I hope the writing assignments will not crash again on this issue. ItÂ´s very demotivating and bit a waste of time to discuss or argue on English or the essay genre as it is used in the US. For example in our area (CE)	 the essay is considered to be a sophisticated elaborated literary work and not the case of a strict form for oneÂ´s ""reflection"". Our high school students write their ""reflections"" as the basic form for their ideas. To write an essay according to ""our"" genre characteristics	 you should be at least journalist or a professional writer	 so I think that arguing on the essayÂ´s level or practicing something	 that is in other parts of the world completely different	 will not help education. I use English for communication - in that case I think in English. But this does not mean	 that my first and mother language is English or that English is necessarily my lifelong passion. Various languages and cultures are.
Wishing all of you many success	 sincerely NAME1081751 "

Hello to everyone!<br /><br />Are we going to have the possibility to view the lectures after the 23rd of June? And can we still have access to the OLI textbook for some months?&nbsp;

"Hi to all!!!<br /><br />I am a teacher from Greece (I teach chess in young children and the use of computers in adults) and personally	 I am taking this course because psychology is a very broad and interesting field which due to the fact that is concerned about human	 could assist on the way I teach.<br /><br />Whether or not you are satisfied with the grades received by our fellow students	 I would like to point out some issues that have concered me a lot. This seminar is about gainning knowledge about psychology and not just having a paper that ""proves"" that we have this knowledge.<br /><br />First of all	 the way evaluation had to be done was not	 in my opinion	 right. We had to select between 2 or 3 options and nothing more nothing less. A comment box could have solved part of the problem and help the author of the assignment have a clear understanding of the possible ommitted things.<br /><br />The comment box I would suggest to be like this:<br />Before submition of the evaluation	 the students should send his/ her comments to the author of the assignment	 the latter should have the ability to answer those comments	 and finally the person who is to evaluate the assignment taking into consideration the answer to his/her comments should evaluate and submit it.<br /><br />Secondly	 I assume that many of us had not mention the exact words ""hypothesis""	 ""dependent variable""	 ""independent variable"" or did not write them in bold letters like ""<b>dependent variable: X</b>""	 ""I<b>ndependent variable: Y</b>"" etc. Therefore	 it was up to the peer student to read more carefully and give a higher grade. Not all of us are English native speakers and this should be considered.<br /><br />I know (from personal experience) that it is a really hard work to evaluate assignments but I believe that assignments should be evaluated by experts and not by students	 or evaluated by students (as to learn more things) but later commented and evaluated by some expert.<br /><br />In general I am really satisfied with this course and I hope that in next assignment will be successful for all of us	 and learn more through this experience because all that counts is knowledge and not simply a grade.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> "
"Hello	<br />The role of natural in classic conditioning / ""Learning by doing""	 Page 77	 Task #2 and Task #3:<br />I would appreciate any of your advise because I am somewhat confused about the answers of these 2 tasks:<br />Task #2: the stimulus is the salty food.

I was not able to submit the assignment because I kept getting an error. Can we please extend the deadline by a day and submit the assignment or my saved assignment can be considered. It is not our fault that there was a technical issue. I dont want my overall grades to be affected. It is extremely important that this gets submitted.

"Yes	 I agree with u that it's a totally different thing when there's no more connection between paragraphs because it just shows that no effort was made to connect ideas	 but conversely	 I also encountered students who were too philosophical in the discussion&nbsp;but&nbsp;critical thinking was not displayed and there is absence of learning application. Ideas&nbsp;were too remote. That's the two sides of the coin. But I&nbsp;still give them passing <br />grades trying to decipher answers in those philosophical words.<br /><br />&nbsp;And &nbsp;this course gave a different instruction re plagiarism. <b>They are more concern with critical thinking and application of knowledge learned.&nbsp; </b><br />But I agree with u	 you can feel when effort was no made that even sentences were no longer connected. I've been an asst. associate professor and I know what you mean. That's a totally different story.<br />But copying of some words for me is alright because they are just following instruction by Alex. Therefore it's not their fault to follow instruction. Further I honestly believe that<br />these students choose to spend more time in analysis using deductive or inductive reasoning than in rephrasing or paraphrasing&nbsp; words. But I respect your opinion though "

"OH God	 what a nightmare. I'm gonna be veeery flexible and elastic on this one but... really? It doesn't matter if there is a conclusion or not?? If the psychologists are mentioned? Wasn't that all about	 according to Alex?! Not in the rubric! And what about cultural factors? Has ANYONE mentioned those? ooo	 hope to pass this one smoothly.&nbsp; "
I agree with an and Kathleen. It is really hard to read and concentrate on the material in OLI. It's tiring and slow and some of the material is tedious. I enjoy the lectures but I would not recommend the course due to the difficulties of getting through OLI 
"Thank you to Professor Smith	 Alex and the rest of the team for a great experience. The quality of the lectures was excellent as was the OLI material. I would gladly enroll in another course should you decide to offer a more advanced level. Why not offer a course on your specialized field of study? I would be very interested to learn about the research you have done.<br /><br />NAME787034 "
"... and just to add that this score is lower than the first assignment although one of the evaluator wrote ""Woow! awesome job on this one"".... so I really think I am missing the marks of one person..... "

"Hi Susan	 &nbsp;wow	 you majored in basic medicine. I applaud you that is definitely a big accomplishment. I'm sure you can finish this course. So join in with us and let's learn something interesting. So you want to make friends here? Well let me be the first to offer you my friendship. "
"I calculated the grades according to Alex's link (excel file)- Thanx Alex it was very useful!!<br /><br />But	 I thought our worst grade would not count in the final sum....<br /> "
"Seems to me that there's a mistake in second ""Learn by Doing"" on p. 44.&nbsp; Question asks you to ""pick the type of signal that goes along the nerve from the sensory receptor on the body to the brain.""

"It would	 be very nice	 if because of <i>late announcement</i>&nbsp;of <b>distinction option</b> to retake the final test. <br />Personally I have 86 %	 and I had very little time these days so I did not put as much effort as i could in the final exam	 a retry would be nice :)<br />But still	 I had a great time	 I learned a lot.

"3 hours	 really? I think this has been the most difficult quizz but	 are you trying to take some video and oli notes and then review them a little bit befor taking the quizz? <br />That works fine for me! :)<br /> "
I dont know if i will be able to complete this course because of extensive reading in OLI...... 
"Hey Everyone	 I just wanted to say&nbsp;I really enjoyed this course. I don't want it to come to an end. I hope that Coursera will host another extension to this one or Psychology II. I hope that I pass and recieve a certificate as I have really applied myself and learned alot. I feel I like I definitely deserve a reward for all the effort I put forth. <br /> "
"Yes	 many thanks. Coursera could and should offer&nbsp; course(s) on clinical psychology too. This would be absolutely fantastic! Does anyone know if anything is in the pipeline? I really liked the course by Prof. Rostain on ADHD. Courses on other disorders would be highly appreciated. Many thanks! <br /> "
"Go to your name up top right corner and click it.&nbsp; Then go down to courses	 and chances are you won't be showing as passed any yet if this is your first coursera course (as there is an error with the final grading)	 so you'll have to click on courses taken	 and then it will show that you didn't earn enough to pass the course (because the grade won't include the final exam)	 but once they fix the glitch	 then you'll be able to access it that way.<br /> "
"I am sorry to hear about your grade.&nbsp; Your assignment had a great deal of information contained within it.&nbsp; One of my biggest concerns with the written assignments is that in writing the assignment	 students are addressing the points given in the extremely brief instructions given by either Dr. Smith or Alex.&nbsp; Unfortunately	&nbsp;when it comes to assessing or grading other students assignments	 the rubric used is touching on points beyond the instruction.&nbsp; The assignment asked students to take a stance on either schizophrenia or illigence and then select whether we felt it was primarily nature or nuture.&nbsp; Having an assessment question that asks if the author of the paper discussed the genetic component of the assignment is completely out of line	 particularly if the student is selecting the nuture aspect of the assignment.&nbsp; If the objective of the assignment was to really have students discuss both sides of the selected topic	 then clearly state it.&nbsp; Don't create a rubric that is heavily based on genetics and heredity as this grading rubric most definitely was.&nbsp; I know this doesn't help your grade	 but I do support your concerns about the lopsided and inappropriate rubric/assessment that was used on this second assignment. "
"In the text	 page 114	 DIGT at the bottom	 third question in regards to mental retardation. &nbsp;Retardation is defined as 70 and below	 and 70 is two standard deviations <b><i>below</i></b> average. &nbsp;When I answer ""-2"" I get this question incorrect. &nbsp;When I change it to ""2"" - that is to say a positive 2 - I get the question correct.<br /><br />So are standard deviation units <i><b>always</b></i> described as a positive number?

"Kind of you	 Mr Alex. Thanks for the assignment.<br /> "

"I agree NAME2093107 Isabel. We are taking here about students in the process of learning	 not experts..but I was expecting- maybe too much- a degree of correctness and lucidity- beyond the given rubrics- to see the&nbsp;experimental&nbsp;design requested as a WHOLE. Well	 I&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;see- not in my case- this ""view from a plane"" for my essay. I'm not sad	 but I'm dissapointed.

"<span style=""color: rgb(51	 51	 51);"">For me	 having a professor or automated system mark my work	 is like a specialist doctor looking at my genitals	 and doing a peer assessment is like dropping my trousers in public and hoping someone says something nice :)&nbsp;<br /><br /></span>The pressure of marking someone's assessment fairly can be overwhelming - you have to make sure they don't assume they've learnt something when they haven't	 and you have to do your best to work out what they mean even if the wording doesn't quite fit together properly	 you have to be careful to not mark someone unfavourably because they're coming across as know-it-all and you want them to see that because of one tiny error they've made they really actually don't understand everything	 you don't want to mark someone overly positively because you can see how much effort they've put in even if they've missed the point entirely because that would be doing them a disservice. You have to be careful not to assume that other markers have down or upmarked people for any of the reasons you're considering doing that	 and then compensating for them. What if the grade you give them means they quit the course	 their confidence takes a massive bashing and their entire life goes horribly wrong from then on? What if the grade you give them is too high and as a result they decide they know more than they do	 buy some treatment drug off the internet and accidentally kill someone? It's also quite hard to judge whether someone else understands the material when you're not confident of your own understanding. When people are very clear and precise but have said something very different to you	 how do you mark them fairly? Even within the marking guidelines there's usually room for interpretation	 if you assume they're right	 you then add to your own worry about whether you've understood the material and the results date becomes more loom-y	 or you assume they're wrong - but what if they're right??!!! What if you get cocky and think you know all the answers	 and someone is watching how you assess stuff and laughing at what a dickhead you are for thinking you know anything? Sometimes when presented with a clear	 precise	 differing answer to your own it can undermine your belief that you've learnt anything at all	 that you're even capable of learning anything at all	 that you should even be bothering	 wouldn't it just be fairer to everyone and safer if you went back to bed and maybe tried the course again next time...? It's very VERY hard to not care about these things and ""just mark to the best of your ability"" and take it for what it is. The decisions I make	 even if it's just to click 0	5 or 10 can be potentially life altering for me	 and just because I can see the logic that my one set of marks won't dictate anyone's final grade	 and I'm perfectly capable of seeing that I'm not responsible for other peoples' choices	 and that a lot of people don't even care about the grade	 and any other piece of logic or fact you care to throw at me about why I'm being irrational	 illogical or melodramatic	 none of that changes that this is the stuff that goes through my head and needs to be addressed before I even click the enroll button on a course.<br /><br />The above is what I could have written before a lot of hard work to get all that sort of stuff in check in order to be able to function. It is offered as an insight into how peer assessments might be challenging for someone with an anxiety disorder. I suspect that might not work though as I can look at it myself and just think	 ""well	 you just deal with it don't you"" but for years the complexity of all the outcomes and possibilities of any tiny decision could floor me.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm not offering my opinion on the actual topic as other people have already laid the matter to rest	 as I see it.<br /><br /><br /> "

"Apropos of Week 7's focus on cognition and especially OLI Module 30 on ""Cognitive Changes in Late Adulthood""	 see the above titled article published in today's Wall Street Journal. &nbsp;The article on the first page of the ""Personal Journal"" section is about a study funded by NIH which ""found that playing Double Decision can slow and even reverse declines in brain function associated with aging	 while playing crosswords cannot."" &nbsp;""Double Decision briefly displays an image of a vehicle and a particular road sign. &nbsp;As the screen continually shifts	 and assorted vehicles and road signs come and go	 players must watch out for and identify the particular vehicle and sign that appeared at the game's start. &nbsp;The game becomes more challenging as players advance levels	 forcing them to quicken their mental speed..."" &nbsp;As an aging crossword aficionado	 I find this news troubling. &nbsp;Video Lecture 7.4 also talks about the effect of other variables (e.g.	 perceptual speed explained nearly all of the age/memory venn diagram overlap) to explain memory loss associated with aging. &nbsp;For your amusement and edification	 the full article is copied below:<br /><br /><div>

<p>The computer game's concept is relatively simple. Find the matching motor 
vehicle and road sign amid a series of increasing distractions. Succeed and the 
challenge gets quicker and harder.</p>
<p>Cognitive-training games like this one	 Double Decision	 are designed to 
improve brain functions and are at the center of a growing body of research 
looking at their effectiveness as scientists strive to find ways to ward off the 
cognitive declines that usually come with age.</p>
<p>A government-funded study published this month found that playing Double 
Decision can slow and even reverse declines in brain function associated with 
aging	 while playing crossword puzzles cannot. The study builds on an earlier 
large trial which found that older people who played various cognitive games had 
better health-related outcomes	 driving records and performed better at everyday 
tasks such as preparing a meal.</p>
<p>Such research has led groups like AARP	 the big seniors group	 to jump on 
board and offer discounts for certain games that have shown proven benefits. 
</p>
<p>Doctors who work with the elderly say they get many questions about so-called 
brain games and exercises. Despite promising study results	 some doctors say 
there still isn't enough evidence to prove such exercises will help people in 
everyday life. </p>

<p>""What they do is they train you with a computer program to do better on a 
test"" of cognitive function	 said Barbara Messinger-Rapport	 director of the 
Center for Geriatric Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. ""But does that 
mean you do better on real-life activities that utilize those skills such as 
driving â€¦or managing your medications?"" </p>
<p>Fredric Wolinsky	 lead researcher for the latest study and a professor at the 
College of Public Health at the University of Iowa	 said previous studies have 
demonstrated there are real-world benefits to playing certain computer games	 
including a reduction in depression symptoms. A study published in 2011 as part 
of a multi-year	 government-funded trial	 known as ACTIVE	 showed that 
participants followed for six years had a 50% lower rate of motor-vehicle 
accidents following cognitive training	 said Dr. Wolinsky	 who didn't 
participate in that research. The study appeared in the Journal of the American 
Geriatrics Society.</p>

<p>The computer game Double Decision helped boost players' 
brain function	 a study found. Doing crossword puzzles had no such benefit. 
</p></div></div></div>
<p>The latest study	 called the Iowa Healthy and Active Minds Study	 published 
this month in the online journal PLOS ONE	 was a randomized controlled trial 
involving 681 healthy people. Participants were divided into two age groupsâ€”from 
50 to 64	 and 65 and over. People in each group were assigned either to play 
Road Tour	 which has since been renamed Double Decision	 or to do computerized 
crossword puzzles; some did the exercises in the lab and others at home. </p>
<p>Double Decision briefly displays an image of a vehicle and a particular road 
sign. As the screen continually shifts	 and assorted vehicles and road signs 
come and go	 players must watch out for and identify the particular vehicle and 
sign that appeared at the game's start. The game becomes more challenging as 
players advance levels	 forcing them to quicken their mental speed as 
distractions multiply and images become harder to distinguish. The study	 which 
was funded by the National Institutes of Health	 involved playing the game a 
minimum of 10 hours over a five-to-eight-week time period. One group played for 
an additional four hours after 11 months.</p>

<p>Before beginning the study	 participants were given standard cognitive tests	 
many involving executive-function tasks such as concentration and shifting from 
one mental task to another. The results were ranked relative to the average 
performance on those tests for the participants' age group. </p>
<p>The same tests were administered a year later. People assigned to do 
crossword puzzles showed typical cognitive one-year declines	 Dr. Wolinsky said. 
But the groups who played the computer game showed a clear improvement compared 
with the normal loss of cognitive function as people age. The amount of 
improvement ranged from two to seven years	 depending on which executive 
function was being tested. People who worked at home improved at the same rate 
as those who were in the lab. </p>
<p>Improvements in the younger group matched those among the older participants. 
""That's really important	"" said Dr. Wolinsky. It suggests ""we are able to start 
the recovery process sooner	 rather than waiting until the cognitive decline has 
become so large.""</p>
<p>The study followed similar researchâ€”the ACTIVE trialâ€”also sponsored by the 
NIH. In that trial	 about 2	800 elderly participants showed improved memory	 
reasoning and visual processing speed after playing an earlier version of the 
Double Decision game	 said Dr. Wolinsky	 who also worked on that earlier 
research. </p>
<p>The ACTIVE study also tested the time it took to do daily activities	 like 
preparing a meal	 and performance tests	 such as reading price tables to pick 
the best telephone provider	 Dr. Wolinsky said. Participants showed improved 
performance compared with those who didn't get such cognitive training. </p>
<p>In the latest study	 Dr. Wolinsky said he chose to use the updated Double 
Decision game in part because it is available for home users. In comparing 
computer-game use with another activity	 he said he chose crosswords because 
many older people enjoy the puzzles and the general perception is that they keep 
the brain and mind active and engaged. </p>
<p>San Francisco-based Posit Science Corp.	 the company that makes Double 
Decision and other brain games	 expects soon to participate in multisite studies 
looking at the impact such games could have in delaying or possibly preventing 
the onset of Alzheimer's disease	 said Michael Merzenich	 a professor emeritus 
at the University of California	 San Francisco and chief scientific officer of 
Posit Science. </p>
<p>AARP recently began offering its members discounts on several Posit Science 
games	 said Deborah Abernathy	 director of AARP Brain Health. ""Their exercises	 
specifically	 we found were very helpful. They're fun	 they're short and they're 
easy to do and they're online	"" she said. </p>
<p>Dr. Wolinsky said he doesn't currently have a financial relationship with 
Posit Science. He did consulting work with the company for a total of 15 days 
from 2007 to 2009 as part of the analysis of the earlier ACTIVE study	 he 
said.</p>
<p>Dr. Wolinsky said the next study he expects to pursue will use functional MRI 
imaging to measure changes in the brain in people participating in 
cognitive-training exercises	 he said. </p>
<p>P. Murali Doraiswamy	 a professor of psychiatry at Duke University Medical 
Center in Durham	 N.C.	 said the Iowa study was one of the best and most 
rigorous to show the benefits of brain training in older age. But a problem with 
brain-training games is that people often get bored and don't continue with 
them. ""It's a very promising area	"" he said. ""I think what we have to do is we 
have to make the games fun.""</p>

"From my perspective	 the biggest flaw in these assignments is not being able to see the rubric PRIOR to completing the assignment. "
For simple and comprehensive demonstration check the work of Karen Pryor. You can find her work on YouTube as well as in bookstores. <br /><br />She's an incredible trainer for animal behaviour and for the behaviour of her children - according to my personal experience these 2 are not so far from each other ;-)&nbsp; 
"Hi there	<br /><br />just to start by saying that this course is amazing!&nbsp;I love OLI	 it's super cool to directly apply the learned materials to real life situations.<br /><br />I started the pre-test and thought it would be handy to have a 'don't know' option. At the moment I have to make random guesses for questions which I do not know the answer for	 so afterwards it will be a bit tricky to compare what I knew	 guessed and learned.<br /><br /> "
"Hey guys	 I did missed the assignment too	 but I though it was due on the 20th of this month?&nbsp; I type my but just was not able to submit it because I though it&nbsp;was due on the 20th of this month.&nbsp;I really don't know if this going to affect our grade.&nbsp; "
"Well said	 Andrea! Anyone who doesn't think a rubric is necessary for grading ones peers has no idea what a peer assessment entails. And	 like so many others in this forum	 I am speaking from experience!! It's bad enough that our grades rely on non-professionals (no offense	 but we're all here to learn. I don't presume I know nearly as much as the professor)	 but to leave it all up to what THEIR (peers) interpretation of what a good paper is	 is simply NOT FAIR to people who have worked so hard to come this far. My grades have been great so far	 I've really worked hard. To think that it could all turn around	 and I could fail this class just because people aren't clear on exactly what you expect. Just because my idea of what you want is not the same as someone else's. Yes	 peer assessments can work... IF THEY'RE DONE RIGHT!!! I know	 I will try my hardest to write a great paper	 following the guidelines that Alex gave. Will that be enough when it comes time for my peers to grade it?<br /> "
"I have an issue with the last question	 comparing hypothesis and theory. &nbsp;A scientific theory has more evidence supporting it than does an hypothesis. &nbsp;As the course is psychology as a science	 I would think the scientific definition of theory would apply - the Theory of Relativity	 for example. "

"The problem summary:<br />Calculation of the Grand Total of your END Score<br />Steps to reproduce:<ol><li>In the annoucements can be written that the first 10 questions of the final exam are to be considered the last quizz. (It also stated that the final exam would contain 30 questions and not 35	 but that is just a detail).</li><li>For the calculation of your end score it is important to know that the treshold of 70% and 90%	 respectively	 can be influenced by the attribution of the answers (right or wrong) to the last quizz (of week 12) and not to the final exam.</li><li>Why? The average score of the quizzes will be less influenced by one outlier (bad or good score)	 since the mean is calculated on N = 11 or (as I propose 12). However	 for the final exam the score is the mean (N=1). So	 if you have made mistakes in the first questions in the final exam (which should be attributed to the quizzes scores) this will influence your grade for the final exam relatively strong.</li><li>Question to the staff. Will you attribute the answers of the first 10 questions of the final exam to the quizzes scores or will you include these in the final exam?

"EMAIL19762 - In contrast I found Week 2 easier than Week 1	 as the information was more structured.&nbsp; Not so much as how it was presented in the OLI	 but more along ""this connects to that	 etc"" which for my mind and learning style allowed for a quicker and more thorough understanding of the material as compared to Week 1	 which seemed more direct memory work trying to remember the names of the scientists and their particular schools.&nbsp; Despite that I still scored a 9 in Week 1	 and a 10 Week 2.&nbsp; Now I'm trying to catch up with Weeks 3 and 4	 though I'm still on track to be able to complete the course for the certificate.<br /> "

"<i></i>So	 if the new and improved DSM-V ""cancels"" the 5 axis on which a mental disorder was diagnosed and the therapist would use this axis to summarize the patient's condition	 then how is it done from now on?! "
"This is a really interesting course. It sure does get into the details! <br /><br />I now love the OLI though was skeptical at first. It's really fun due to the mixture of teaching methods employed. Text. Videos. Mini quizzes. Drag and drop puzzle questions. Fun!<br /><br />And what we are learning is really interesting... well	 not every single stitch of it. Ha-ha! I did dismally in the OLI mini-quizzes in regards to which psychologist championed which theories during which time period and all that. Retch! Hated it! Ha-ha! Knew I really had to study that or I was gonna tank the weekly quiz.&nbsp;<br /><br />It's exciting to see good folks like Nancy	 Alicia	 Christine	&nbsp;<span>Phillip/Jimmy	 Anna	 Marilyn	 and Brian chatting so nicely.

"Isabela	<br /><br />Your doubt is very valid. My take is as follows.<br /><br />The articles you have mentioned	 viz.	 syringe	 razor	 mirror	 etc. may bring back past memories and lead to spontaneous recovery. NAME487897ut relief can come about by way of <i><b>altered association.</b></i> The articles have <i><b>productive uses </b></i>as well and the affected person will <i><b>train to associate </b></i>them with such productive uses. He will <i><b>keep rehearsing</b></i> them and at one stage the new association takes precedence over the old experiences and finally extinction is strengthened.<br /> "

"On the second Learn by Doing exercises on page 48 unit 9	 we were supposed to get evaluated our Just Noticeable Differences .<br /><br />First there were two pink clircles	 and then to red circles. <br /><br />The pink color is more weak	 so the magnitude is lower.

"Teachers are not mysterious magical person able to be more objective than other students on here. I've been teaching biology/neuroscience at uni (and marking exercises and essays) so I know what I'm talking about. If you go to uni	 a large % of your work won't be marked by the lecturer but by teaching assistants	 who are for most of them	 people who just started their PhD and were the one undertaking the same exams few months ago. Therefore peer assesment is almost exactely the same thing that what happens when you go to uni. The only difference is that here you're conscious that people marking you are also students whereas at uni you don't realise it because they are called you 'teachers' so you assume they know more etc.. In addition	 one again from my own experience	 evaluating other people's work is one of the best way to learn and improve yourself. "
The adjustment has still not been made to my certificate. (Adding with distinction)&nbsp; I would be grateful if it is done. Thank you<br /> 
"Joann Roze	<br /><br />Quizzes carry 30% of the total grade. Out of 11 quizzes	 only the high scoring 10 will be counted. As of now	 4 quizzes have expired and 7 more are available. If you attempt the 7 quizzes successfully	 you will score 21%. There are 2 assignments carrying 40% and the final exam carrying 30%.<br />One needs 70% overall to pass and earn a certificate. You stand a bright chance of reaching it. However	 you have to spend time and work hard to catch up. All the best to you :-)<br /> "

"hello everyone! my name is eleni nikolaidi and i come from the island of crete in greece. i live in athens and work as a pianist and piano teacher. i had taken small psycology courses in the past	 while studying archaeology and art history at the university of athens.Interacting every day with students of all ages and fellow performers i find that this course will be very helpfull in order to fully understand different behaviours and potential problems in my collaborations. I am particularly interested in how perception	 learning and memory works	 since these are elements directly attached to the performance of music. needless to say that i have students with some kind of learning disability and i really would like to know how to help them. i hope this course is everything i expect...

"Done	 thank you! But it was not obvious for a first-time coursera participant! "
"I enojoyed very much the last module (especially	 the lecture about biomethods). <br />I don't regret that I have taken this course.. <br />Please	 continue making the lectures as interesting as they are now!<br /> "
thanks for this information I failed the class so I will not get a certificate at least I learned a lot 
"One of the monocular perception traits is about shadows. As we saw on the optical illusion of the checkered board	 things under shadows are automatically assumed to have a fairer shade.<br /><br />That's&nbsp;why the black square looked white.<br /><br /><br />I wonder if a person wearing a baseball cap	 or a cawboy hat looks more white?<br /> "
"Hari	<br /><br />many thanks for your response. Actually i have the same opinion with you	 but i do not want to take such a risk because i do not know if our evaluation contributes to the final grade of our peer's assignment. I prefer to wait until i take a response from the teaching staff.<br /><br />Agnieszka<br /><br />The solution that you suggest may be a very good alternative. On the other hand an automated translation always has problems. I think that the staff should give these persons a second chance to translate their assignements and &nbsp; resubmit them. Of course this is only a suggestion.<br /> "
I chose schizophrenia as well. I'm gonna use as few words as possible. Thanks for your offer to review my work but I think I can manage it: I'll use course materials and Wikipedia. XD<br />

"The course was fantastic	 and I really enjoyed it. My grade is not corrected properly. I thank you for all the teachings and enjoyment. But I don't find it fair that my second assignment &nbsp;was corrected by only ONE person who decided to give me a poor grade. I corrected at least three other students. ( and 5 on the first assignment). Why am I judged only by one?..... All my tests except for one in which I got 7 out of 10	 have been mostly 9 out 10	 10 out of 10	 and two 8 out of 10.<br />I got a certificate	 and I feel good about my effort. But for future courses	 if I can give a suggestion	 I think it would be better to make the student ""think"" more on the test	 having a computer generated score	 and not to put an entire course effort at the mercy of one other student	 who may not be qualified to grade or want to do it. I honestly do not think my score represents the effort. But none the less	 the important thing is that I learned a lot	 and enjoy the topics and talks tremendously. Thank you!<br /><br />NAME2266083 "
"Hello :) My name is Mimi and I'm studying psychology at the University of Messina	 Italy. I find the courses I'm taking at the university to be boring and I'm looking for a more interactive and stimulating way to study. That's why I'm here :) "

"Anon	<br /><br />This is what I understood.<br /><br /><b>Principle:</b> The perceived size of an object depends not only on its retinal size	 but also on the size of objects in its visual environment.<br /><br /><b>1(a) (Scenario at horizon):</b> The skyline of the horizon (trees	 clouds	 outlines of buildings) that falls between the eyes and the moon	 gives a cue of exaggeration that the moon is big. So	 it is perceived to be 50% larger.<br /><br /><b>1(b) (Scenario at horizon):</b> If the surrounding horizon cues (skyline articles like trees) are removed from vision by using a tube of rolled up paper and if the moon is viewed through it	 then the moon appears smaller (retinal size).<br /><br /><b>2 (Scenario at zenith):</b> There is nothing between the eyes and the Moon when it is vertically at zenith. There are no surrounding cues and consequently there is no distortion and so the moon appears small (retinal size). This view is equal to the Scenario 1(b).<br /> "
"Cor. Anon is right. Repeat ""there is <b>no quiz for week 12</b>"". Please do not mis-interpret what Alex announced. Many people try to bend the rules to their own liking. There is no promise by Alex	&nbsp; and your heading "" <b><i>The first 10 questions of the Final Exam must </i>legally<i> be attributed to the quizzes and not to the Final exam""</i></b>&nbsp; is just pushing it.

"You can take the quizes as many times as you want as a learning experience	 but only the frst score is recorded. And that' s just logical. it's supposed to be&nbsp;a test	 not an exercise. did you have several attempts at tests while you were at school?<br /><br />I think Alex explained it very well in the new anouncement ""you saw how things worked when you joined"".

With regard to the grading. In my opinion:<br />30% x sum ((Q1-Q11) + ((q1-10)final exam)/12) + 40% x sum ((A1-2)/4) + 30% (final exam sum (q11-q35)/25) = Final grade<br /> 
"What about validity? In one of the experiments I have got to review	 the author says they want to test one thing	 but the dependent variable is measured in a way that it relates to a completely different thing IMHO. So	 although the experiment is alright and well done and they do indeed research a certain aspect	 they do not look into the thing they said they would look into!<br />And then in another experiment: behaviour... you say that the dependent variable has to be about behaviour. Can intelligence be considered as behaviour? It is much more than behaviour actually	 isn't it?<br />I do not know how to review these experiments!<br /> "

"Yes	 I have to agree there was a general negativity to peer assessments and I mentioned this to Dr. Smith in another post. This was my first experience with online courses and Coursera so the peer assessments was a novelty for me but after seeing the increasing animosity of various posts concerning this subject I'm led to believe that some kind of modification	 even small	 will take place. Unfortunately	 it won't happen to us and what we received is what we received. Believe me	 I didn't do well on the PA and may not pass the course for that specific reason. And yes	 from what I read there was quite a bit of plagiarism but I'm sure Dr. Smith and his staff with take care of that. I totally agree with your opinion of the OLI textbook and lectures...they are excellent. <br /> "

"hello Alex and all 	&nbsp;<br />Just a quick	 constructive feedback i wanted to share - i liked the course content and the nice balance of video/OLI book	 the only thing that requries improvement is the Score Overview ( Dashboard) - i think there should be one place in the system where students can go to anytime and see their current scores ( say a kind of a dashboard with clear scores per quiz	 assignement and exam + percentage/ potential to pass and obtain certificate) - i am still super unclear whether i passed or not and what is my current status as the Dashboard/.My Scores doesnt show any points	 just the color coding ( that doesnt help)&nbsp;<br />thanks 	 NAME2980905&nbsp; "
There is repetition of text on page 167 of OLI.

"Hi Alex	<br /><br />Since the pre test was not announced beforehand	 I	 as I guess others in this course	 was not aware of it until I went in today to check out the week 3 materials as well as take the week 2 quiz.&nbsp;<br /><br />Is it possible to get an extension on it	 I would truly like to take it as I believe others would who did not know about it in a timely manner. "
"Yeah	 I agree too! I actually have spent a lot of time on the OLI textbook	 and I need to search for the meaning for some words in order to have a better understanding. "
"There are so many enrolled in this course	 how many about 1 million? È˜) Serious	 I wish I know.... "
"<p>I hadn&#39;t seen this thread before but I loved the initiative. Two thumbs up! And just to reinforce the idea	 I&#39;m really happy to be here.

"I guess the evaluation phase of the assignment has taken a toll on the second assignment!! Though I got excellent reviews from 2 of my peers	 a third one seems to have given me zeros mostly and my score is 8.5/15. Two of the peers have recommended full marks	 but I guess the zeros by the third averaged the score out! What a debacle!! "
"I have a problem understanding this on p.27 of the OLI ""Thus	 neurons can provide more energy to the neurons down the line by firing faster but not by firing more strongly.<span>&nbsp;Furthermore	 the neuron is prevented from repeated firing by the presence of a refractory periodâ€”a brief time after the firing of the axon in which the axon cannot fire again because the neuron has not yet returned to its resting potential.""&nbsp;<br /><br />I don't understand how it can fire faster but not stronger. If the size/thickness of the axon is fixed/inelastic	 I think firing faster is the same as firing stronger. And since it cannot repeat-fire	 so I presume firing faster means in faster in one single firing and not repeat-firing faster. What have I missed?&nbsp;<br /><br />Many thanks in advance for any help.</span> "

"<p>I've googled for it and found out that hypothalamus indeed acts as a gland. Some cells in this brain structure are neurosecretory cells which means they produce <i>secretion</i> of special hormones called <a title=""Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Releasing_hormone"" target="""" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Releasing_hormone"">releasing factors</a>. These releasing hormones affect pituitary gland and control the release of pituitary hormones.

"So... I'm back to this subject	 as I find it non-efficient	 for the quiz to have a closing date for example on the 26th of April and the survey to have a deadline just a few days after being opened. It doesn't matter when ""each week's instruction is complete"" or if the quiz is relevant to the survey. My point is simple: Since you want us (optional) to take part in this survey and it's based on our learning and the OLI modules	 how can I participate with honesty if I haven't completed the OLI units? And obviously when I finish OLI I take the quiz.... Plus	 I don't see why you can't extend the date for the survey?! So plz	 I wanna participate in the survey but AFTER I have studied OLI	 thus I need more time... Please consider it.&nbsp; "
"I get 3 of 5 for dependent variable	 mentioning it in experiment description and then separately wrote:&nbsp;<br /><b>Experiment variables:</b><br /><b>---------------------------</b><br /><b>&lt;. . . &gt;</b><br /><b>Dependent variable: Object detection&nbsp;quickness.</b><br /><b>Operational definition:&nbsp;Time until object(s) is detected (min:sec).</b><b>&nbsp;</b><br /><br />And additionally mentioned it while proving that experiment is valid	 reliable	 ethical	 independent variable occurs prior to dependent etc.<br /><span>Do you have a clue where I'm wrong?</span> "

"Alicia	 I second your concern. However	 I think that Prof Smith and his colleagues would be more concerned about the legitimacy of peer-assessment than are the students since their stakes are higher.

"Hi Nancy	 how you doing sweetie? It's a pity this course finishes	 I hope we can share some other courses in the future and study together. Did you get the certificate? I think so	 but not really sure	 I scored a bit low in the final exam and the assigments... "
"<br />Under another thread I have discussed that the scores on the Week 12 material are weighed relatively heavy in the final note (ca. 3 times)	 because the answer on the first 10 questions in the final exam are apparently considered as final exam response and not quizz scores. Since it was announced that the final exam was a cumulative one it was to be expected that every week material was equally representend in the questions on the final exam. That was not the case.<br /><br />No justification is given for this fact by the staff and I have not read anywhere that the week 12 material was somehow more important than the materials in the other week.<br /><br />Was this intented or is it just a consequence due to the calculation of the final grade in accordance with the formula given in the announcements?<br /><br />I am looking forward to an answer.<br /> "

I think it is out of 15. 
"Not only expectations	 but the fact that no expert would grade it!!!!&nbsp;<br /><br />The fact that other students and not an expert correct the experiment takes validity out of the grade you obtain	 so we should not have put so much into it!!!! "
I failed the class because of the papers and one missed quiz so upset after all the work. I have bachelors in marketing and two masters was just taking for enjoyment and possible certificate well guess not getting certificate. 
"Hi Friends	<br /><br />Joined the course now. I know I have missed a lot. Can I catch up with the missed lectures and quiz etc. Request the instructors and students to help me out.

"I can read and as I already explained I have more than a 90% grand total	 so I don't wanna bend any rules. It is an improper argument to use.<br /><br />I understand what I read that there is no quiz 12	 okay	 and that questions concerning Week 12 are incorporated in the final exam. It is okay to me	 but why than annoucing that (10) questions regarding week 12 are the first questions of the final exam? May be to let the students know that week 12 will be overheard? I can live with that	 or to let someone guess that these first 10 questions regarding week 12 are extra heavily weighted in the end score for grading? If that was the case it would have been appropriate that Alex or the staff had made that point clear. They didn't do it or maybe they were not aware of this effect. I don't know.<br /><br />However	 it is inconsistent to give the 10 questions regarding the stuff of Week 12 a weight of 10/35 in stead of 1/11 as is the case for the other quizzes. <br /><br />Or do you think it is consistent to let the scores on the first questions of week 12 be weighted heavier than scores on other quizes (1-11)? And if so	 what is the reason for this difference. It is not made clear to me anyhow. The contrary is true. Quizzes were weighted 30% of average of their sum.<br /><br />By the way:&nbsp; the announcement was wrong	 because there are MORE than 10 question regarding week 12 incorporated in the final exam and b. announced is that there were only 30 final exam questions (including the first 10 regarding Week 12). There were 35 questions. This sudden change is not motivated.<br /><br />Maybe someone can explain to me why this is not inconsistent?<br /><br /><br /> "

"Week 2	 I quote from the picture: ""The portion of the sensory and motor cortex devoted to receiving messages that control specific regions of the body is determined by the amount of fine movement that area is capable of performing.

Why do movement and sensing require more cortical space since the are only translated through small and fine reactions?! Thx. "

"<p>In today&#39;s Science Times section of the NY Times this interesting article describes the work of two researchers from Norway Edvard and May-Britt Moser.  Apparently (in 2005) they discovered &quot;grid cells&quot;	 which seem to form a map of the local environment.  Each grid cell fires in a hexagonal pattern that helps a rat track where it is in space.  John O&#39;Keefe of London discovered &quot;place cells&quot; in the 1970&#39;s.  The grid cells	 in combination with cells that sense head direction and others that sense borders or boundaries form a kind of dead-reckoning navigation system in the brain.  Information flows from the cortex to the hippocampus and then back.  Exactly how the grid cells inform the place cells and vice versa is not known.  Although these studies have been done on rats	 grid cells are thought to exist in humans	 too.  The area of the brain that contains the grid cell navigation system is often damaged early in Alzheimer&#39;s and one of the early symptoms of the disease is getting lost.

"Normally	 when you direct the pointer of the mouse to your name in the upper right corner of the web page a pop up menu appears and there should be a link refered as ""Course records"". If you click on that	 a new page opens in which your certificate can be downloaded by pressing the blue button. In the case that it does not appear anything like that	 you might have not completed successfully the course (you have not a grade of 70% or greater).<br />There is a possibility though that the calculations of your grade are wrong therefore recalculate them using the excel file Alex provided to us at the bottom of week 12 and if your grade is above 70% post a thread. There are already many threads for this subject.<br />I hope that this helped.<br />Good luck!<br /> "

"I must admit that I too had some doubts about the underlying reasons for the pretest. Whether it's just paranoia or curiosity I guess I'll never know.

"If I'm not mistaken	 in some early lecture video we've been told that when under stress	 the memory works better?!(I hope I'm not totally off). Still	 in every action movie	 when the bank manager is in front of the vault and under a gun's threat	 he totally forgets the combination!&nbsp; "
I agree that the peer assessments have been disappointing especially the second one.&nbsp; Rubric should be given along with the assignments and the concept of full marks or nothing leaves no room for divergence<br /> 
"It might depend on your learning style. I tend to use a real notebook and a pen	 and take notes. It is a slow process	 but allows me to stay on the concepts longer. Afterwards	 refreshing is easier and faster.<br /><br />You seem like a dedicated student and I'm sure you'll do well. But	 <b>don't let me rush you</b>	 do it your own way and you'll do fine. Some of the questions are easier	 some are harder	 some are puzzling etc. Just like a regular test	 but longer	 and it covers more material than your regular tests.<br /> "
"It's absolutely unbelievable! <br />The rubric has nothing re: how we collect data	 to which aspects of psychology it applies	 or what various psychologists have said about it - all of which were stressed by Alex in his clarification. But culture	 which was never mentioned at all	 is worth 3 of the total of 15 points. <br />Unbelieveable and outrageous! "
"I've tried to make a difference in where people analysed and played around with the information they found from references and the exact copying without any sign of personal input. Some people did use poor referencing but showed a lot of interaction with the information they found. But as a guideline for myself i thought people get out of the course what they put into it. If someone receives a high grade without putting in the effort then what they would have gained is google skills and a grade. These courses offer valuable means to gain personal growth and development	 so whatever the grade the intrinsic reward to me seems the most valuable. For my assignment i used a lot of additional literature with correct referencing. The mere reading up on theories in the field of subject and comparing and analyzing was so much fun and broadened my comprehension and that felt really rewarding. I hope you all enjoyed the assignement just as much. "
Hi!&nbsp;<br /><br />What is the date of our final exam?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br /><br /> 
I completely agree. Please reconsider. Thanks 
I agree that this is very puzzling.&nbsp; I intend to give full marks if it looked like they worked hard and knew what they were talking about.&nbsp; I am having a really hard time applying the rubric. 
Hi. I am NAME2835680 from India. I am a Post Graduate Diploma holder in Management (Finance &amp; Marketing streams). I work as a relationship manager with an Indian Private Bank in the corporate banking division.I opted to join this course out of sheer interest in the area of psychology. This is the first step for me to decide if I would want to shift my career focus into this field. 
"I get 3 of 5 for dependent variable	 mentioning it in experiment description and then separately wrote:&nbsp;<br /><b>Experiment variables:</b><br /><b>---------------------------</b><br /><b>&lt;. . . &gt;</b><br /><b>Dependent variable: Object detection&nbsp;quickness.</b><br /><span><b>Operational definition:&nbsp;Time until object(s) is detected (min:sec).</b></span><b>&nbsp;</b><br /><br />And additionally mentioned it while proving that experiment is valid	 reliable	 ethical	 independent variable occurs prior to dependent etc.<br />Do you have a clue where I'm wrong?

Many thanks! Appreciate it. 
"If I had known I had 2 extra days to study	 I wouldn't have hurried to be done by the deadline	 and would have probably scored the extra point and a half to get my certificate with distinction. How do you consider this even remotely fair to those who did their exams by the deadline?<br /> "
"Oh	 you're right anonymous.&nbsp; My grade doesn't include the final test.&nbsp; It's the total of the quizzes and the peer review assignments.&nbsp; I'm sure it won't take long to fix it. <br /> "
"In a neuroscience course I took on Coursera	 getting a certificate with distinction required a grade over 99.x% (I forget the decimal). The decision was made after looking at the data to see how many students had truly distinguished themselves from the rest (turned out to be about 400 if I remember correctly). I got close (98.x%) but no cookie!<br /><br />I am close here too	 again by about 1%. Ah well :) I did not know there was a possibility to get distinction until after I took my final	 but while it would have been very nice to get the distinction	 I can only blame myself in this case. I knew I did not need a stellar mark on the final to pass	 and skimped on the review a bit. Still	 I am very happy with my final grade as the mistakes I made on the final were mostly because I hesitated and changed a few answers at the last minute (my initial answers turned out to be the correct ones. Oops!) There were also one or two answers where I thought I was picking the right thing	 but in retrospect	 I can see that my reasoning was correct for picking the answers I chose even though I picked the wrong ones (if that makes sense... ie. I knew the material well enough but got confused with some of the terms ---&gt; see lack of review.)<br /><br />In the end	 what really matters is what you have learned and in my experience	 sometimes	 failing can teach you just as much if not more than succeeding (I will not soon forget the answers to the questions I missed!).<br /><br /><br /> "
"Hi	 I did never study psychology but happens to talk a lot with a psychologist of world class. This course is in my opinion just a primer since the whole subject of psychology is un mer a boire. But I am learning sum new stuff. If I compare this course with other courses	 e.g. operations management or statistics	 I found this course quite easy. I am interested in experimetal psychology.<br /> "
"I believe that it's worth to study in a place where you plan to work. Every country has its own specifications and lawful boundaries. While learning	 you make useful connections with people. Therefore	 I don't believe in studying in a country with cheaper education and then moving to UK. <br />Coursera is only one year old	 but it already offers several psychological classes. We don't know what's going to come next	 but I am optimistic. I would rather stay here and wait. <br /> "
"apparently even though I did very well with the quizzes and essays	 I did not get a certificate because I did not fill out the surveys. &nbsp;However	 the syllabus says that the grade depends on the following:<br />quizzes 30%<br />essays 40%<br />final exam 30%<br />NO MENTION OF SURVEYS. "

"The grading rubric for the second peer assessment does not have the level of detail I was expecting	 I'm a bit thrown off	 is anyone else having this problem ? "
"That's an interesting point	 and it has made me wonder why this example was chosen - possibly to emphasise that psychology is a science? Although it appears to relate primarily to biology	 the house fly example may also relate to comparative psychology (the study of animal behaviour)?

I lost alot of time owing to internet connectivity and performed badly in the quizzes in my attempt to beat deadlines. I also did not do one of the peer assessment assignments. Is there any possibility or redoing the whole course?<br /><br />

"<p>Hi Jennifer... A parsimonious theory is one which provides the simplest possible account of its outcomes...  A good theory has 4 important characteristics.. 1) general which means it summarises different outcomes  2) parsimonious	 meaning it provides simplest possible account of those outcomes 3) provides ideas for future research and finally 4) it should be falsiable	 meaning the predictable relationship between different variables can be shown through research to be incorrect.
Hope this solves your doubt.. You can refer to OLI unit 3	 pg 16...</p>

"Why is a moral dilemma categorized as a mental conflict and not as a personality conflict as well? I mean	 one has it's thoughts (mental) but also its standards. That is personality to me.

"Sifting through the forums	 I can see that a lot of people were dissatisfied with the scores they received for both written assignments	 particularly the second one. While I personally got a fair score in the first one	 but a mediocre one for the second one	 it seems plagiarism was better rewarded than original work which showed a genuine understanding of the material. I think many of us are in agreement that the evaluation rubrics were very poor and did not coincide with what the teacher's assistant said would be taken into account.<br /><br />Moreover	 I and a lot of my peers wrote on the forums to encourage the integration of a comment box in the second written assignment	 which was graciously granted by the staff. However	 at least in my case	 very few students took advantage of this potentially very helpful addition!<br /><br />I suppose it's much too late to ask for the written assignments to constitute a lower percentage of the final evaluation. At the very least I recommend that those who feel like I do should mention this issue in the final survey	 which asks for general recommendations and comments.<br /><span><br />This is how I see it: the lectures and the OLI textbook were excellent and very educational.

Are we mandated to do module 52? This is the Psychology post-test. 
"You know guys... it was great to hang out with all of you. But I can see how unfair some of us can be	 and that can cost me certificate and self respect. Maybe I will leave this course. I have waited on it almost for a year. And I tried to learn so hard. I have never cheated with quizzez. I've read all material here and watched all lectures. I've made so big experiment and answered on every question in it. But some man/woman was too lazy to read my essay	 so he/she just picked up 0 to every question in evaluation. Instead	 I've read every essay carefully and gave normal marks. So people who had great scores... think about it. One of you received these scores from me. I have no words. I dont want to make another experiment	 I think I made it good at the first time. I dont want to be noisy here. It is just so unfair...&nbsp; "
Don't you feel that this course requires more time to read OLI Textbook than to watch the lecture videos.. I feel there is lot of description in OLI... 
"Thanx for the link. <br /><br />As you know	 neurotransmitters can excite or inhibit neurons. <br />Excite means to increase the likelihood of the post synaptic neuron to fire	 while inhibit means  to decrease the likelihood of the post synaptic neuron to fire. It can be done through several means. This site describes it very well: <br /><a title=""Link: http://changingminds.org/explanations/brain/brain_chemistry/drug_neuron.htm#7"" target="""" href=""http://changingminds.org/explanations/brain/brain_chemistry/drug_neuron.htm#7"">http://changingminds.org/explanations/brain/brain_chemistry/drug_neuron.htm#7</a><br /><br />As for your question	 a drug (alcohol or caffeine) can block 
the binding sites in postsynaptic receptors (i.e.	 excitatory channels) 	 thus preventing neurotransmitters 
from docking there and activating this channels. As the processes are described on that page you've linked: there is no difference - both block the post synaptic receptor. However	 in the real life the effects of both alcohol and caffeine are much more complicated. <br /> "
"In anticipation of Week 9's focus on personality	 here's an article I found on Zite questioning the efficacy of Myers-Briggs as a personality assessment tool.

<h2>Despite its popularity	 the personality test has been subject to sustained 
criticism by professional psychologists for over three decades.</h2>
<p>By Roman Krznaric</p>
<p><img src=""http://fortuneaskannie.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/PHONENUM7-worker-brains-614xa.jpg?w=614&amp;h=400"" alt=""PHONENUM7-worker-brains-614xa"" /></p>
<p>FORTUNE -- When Frank Parsons opened the world's first career guidance center 
in Boston in 1908	 he began by asking prospective clients 116 penetrating 
questions about their ambitions	 strengths	 and weaknesses (and how often they 
bathed). But then he did something more unusual: He measured their skulls.</p>
<p>Parsons was a committed believer in phrenology. If you had a large forehead	 
he might recommend you become a lawyer or engineer. But if your skull was more 
developed behind the ears	 you were of the ""animal type"" and best suited to 
manual work.</p>
<p>Career advice has	 thankfully	 come a long way since then. But now	 instead 
of measuring the outside of people's heads	 it has become common to measure the 
inside using psychometric tests. Personality testing has grown into a major 
industry and is standard procedure in leadership and management courses	 as part 
of job-interview processes	 and	 increasingly	 in career counselling. But should 
we really trust such tests to deliver scientific	 objective truth?</p>
<p><b>MORE:&nbsp;<a href=""http://features.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2013/05/15/ranbaxy-fraud-lipitor/"" target="""">The epic inside story of fraud at a generic Lipitor 
giant</a></b></p>
<p>I have some bad news for you: Even the most sophisticated tests have 
considerable flaws. Take the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)	 the world's 
most popular psychometric test	 which is based on Jung's theory of personality 
types. Over two million are administered every year. The MBTI places you in one 
of 16 personality types	 based on dichotomous categories such as whether you are 
an introvert or an extrovert	 or have a disposition towards being logical or 
emotional (what it calls ""thinking"" and ""feeling"").</p>
<p>The interesting -- and somewhat alarming -- fact about the MBTI is that	 
despite its popularity	 it has been subject to <a href=""http://www.indiana.edu/~jobtalk/Articles/develop/mbti.pdf"" target=""new"">sustained criticism</a> by professional 
psychologists for over <a href=""http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1580&amp;page=80"" target=""new"">three decades</a>. One problem is that it 
displays what statisticians call low ""test-retest reliability."" So if you retake 
the test after only a five-week gap	 there's around a <a href=""http://www.recruiter.com/i/critique-of-the-myers-briggs-type-indicator-critique/"" target=""new"">50% chance</a> that you will fall into a 
different personality category compared to the first time you took the test.</p>
<p>A <a href=""http://epublications.bond.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&amp;context=hss_pubs"" target=""new"">second criticism</a> is that the MBTI 
mistakenly assumes that personality falls into mutually exclusive categories. 
You are <i>either </i>an extrovert <i>or </i>an introvert	 but never a mix of 
the two. Yet most people fall somewhere in the middle. If the MBTI also measured 
height	 you would be classified as either tall or short	 even though the 
majority of people are within a band of medium height.</p>
<p>The consequence is that the scores of two people labelled ""introvert"" and 
""extrovert"" may be almost exactly the same	 but they could be placed into 
different categories since they fall on either side of an imaginary dividing 
line.</p>
<p>One other thing	 and this matters especially for anybody who thinks 
personality tests can guide them to a perfect career. According to official 
Myers-Briggs documents published by its exclusive European distributor	 the test 
can ""give you an insight into what kinds of work you might enjoy and be 
successful doing."" So if you are	 like me	 classified as INTJ (your dominant 
traits are being introverted	 intuitive	 and having a preference for thinking 
and judging)	 the best-fit occupations include management consultant	 IT 
professional	 and engineer.</p>
<p>Would a change to one of these careers make me more fulfilled? Unlikely	 
according to psychologist David Pittenger	 because there is ""<a href=""http://www.indiana.edu/~jobtalk/Articles/develop/mbti.pdf"" target=""new"">no evidence</a> to show a positive relation 
between MBTI type and success within an occupation â€¦ nor is there any data to 
suggest that specific types are more satisfied within specific occupations than 
are other types."" Pittenger advises ""<a href=""http://www.recruiter.com/i/critique-of-the-myers-briggs-type-indicator-critique/"" target=""new"">extreme caution</a> in [the MBTI test's] 
application as a counselling tool."" Then why is the MBTI so popular? Its 
success	 he argues	 is primarily due to ""the beguiling nature of the 
horoscope-like summaries of personality and steady marketing.""</p>
<p>When I cite the avalanche of critical studies to career counsellors	 coaches	 
and trainers who administer Myers-Briggs tests	 they often point out that the 
test is not designed to match people to ideal careers. Yet many of them ignore 
the evidence and keep on handing them out	 typically because they are still 
believers in it as a guide to personality types	 but sometimes -- I suspect -- 
because it gives their advice a veneer of legitimacy.</p>
<p>Personality tests have their uses	 even if they do not reveal any scientific 
truth about us. If we are in a state of confusion	 they can be a great emotional 
comfort. They also raise interesting hypotheses that aid self-reflection: Until 
I took the MBTI	 I had certainly never considered that IT could offer me a 
bright future (by the way	 I apparently have the wrong personality type to be a 
writer).</p>

great expatriate hiring boom</a></b></p>
<p>Yet MBTI is not a magic pill that offers a secret path to a dream job. Wise 
career counsellors should treat such tests with caution	 using them as only one 
of many ways of exploring who you are. Some even take the sensible step of 
avoiding them altogether	 recognizing that human personality does not neatly 
fall into 16 or any other definitive number of categories: We are far more 
complex creatures than psychometric tests can ever reveal.</p>

I have a real problem. I have not been given and am unable to find the grades I am supposed to give &nbsp;in peer evaluation or where I am supposed to enter these grades. After each evaluation question are a number of options. I have to choose one but there is no grade or score suggested. Where are others finding &nbsp;grades 5.3.2.0. and different grades 5.4.2.0 for another student. My evaluation rubric is totally different. Please advise member of staff. 
"I have still wrong answer on LBD. <br />When I answer 2.5 on the question about mental retardation&nbsp; the system answer is: Thatâ€™s incorrect. But I'm sure it's correct. <br />Please	 fix it. <br /><br /><br /><br /> "
"And in addition from my even previous experience as an undergrad I can definitely you that I had much higher grade that I deserved by teacher that liked me and really bad grad that I do not deserved by teachers that did not like my personality or point of view. Who-ever marks your work	 a teacher or another student	 may lack objectivity so maybe we should just not assess anything at all because it is soooooo unfair	 it's unbearable! Or only do computerized test that test knowledge but not real understanding? "
"Alex	 though I'm not comfortable stating my scores	 I believe I am missing my certificate (I mistakenly was assessed a penalty on on of the peer assessments). "
"Dear Alex	 I still can not find my certificate. I'm sorry. Can you do something about it? By the way	 the cours was exellent. Congratulations to dr Smith and you. <br /> "
"Thank you	 Phoebe	 and I completely agree. &nbsp;This course has been wonderful. "
"<i><b>Availability Heuristic:</b></i> For example	 a person who watches crime reports in TV on regular basis perceives living in the City very unsafe. Another person who never follows crime reports but only watches entertainment programs	 perceives living to be a pleasure.<br /><br /><i><b>Cognitive Accessibility:</b></i> People remember information about their own selves best since the interest of self takes precedence over everything else. Therefore	 for example	 when memory recall is warranted about performances of self and others in the past	 the perception of own performance is magnified with a 'self' bias.<br /><br />AH and CA	 both create bias in perception and recall but for different reasons. The former is availability of information; the latter is biased cognition.<br /> "
"My thoughts exactly	 dear Anon. You shouldn't change the rules mid-game	 that is a consistent rule out there.<br /><br />What is the point of randomly giving the distinction? It's like a super-market saying ""oh	 maybe yesterday we should have given a 50% offer in cheese"". Pointless and irritating.&nbsp;<br /><br />The OLI was good	 the videos were good	 but everything that has to do with grading was a disappointment.<br /><br /><br /> "
"Can`t open lectures video week 2	 it takes me to week 1.&nbsp; "
"I agree	 the rubric is bad. Like many of you I did not refer explicitly to culture	 as it appears to be contained within the environment. So	 I marked accordingly: if the environment is discussed somewhat in depth	 I mark as if culture were discussed too "
May I suggest 'distinction' grading for scorers above a particular level as has been the policy in many coursera courses? 
"Amy	 copy and paste your assigment. "
"Thanks anonymous - I could have sworn they were identical when I first looked! A week is much more practical	 especially as this is Easter weekend. Would be nice if they opened it up earlier in the week	 though	 and posted all the upcoming dates/deadlines on the announcements page. I have to fit doing this around a host of other things.

"The fact that there were too many variables (whatever that may be) is not a sound argument to get upgraded or a second chance. Indeed	 there are apparently a lot of whiners on this forum.

"<p>I understand peoples frustration which is why I posted this.

"So I am curious and would like also your opinion in this matter. I've started only yesterday the course and this is my first course ever.

So today I've started module 2	 but had some&nbsp;difficulties&nbsp;cause I wanna be able to absorb and truly understand rather than just ""copy"" what I see into my ""hard drive""	 my mind. Again 4 hours studying but this time I think I'm in the middle of module 2.

"I did not say miscommunication about plagiarism. Read it again!<br />For example	 when the teacher said ""the way we collect data"".

What I'm saying is we do not have to aggravate those misunderstanding by being too fuzzy about these things.

"<p>Dear Alex	 I request you to please consider the bar for distinction again as I feel it is a little too high for this particular course.. I got a 10 out of 10 in all my weekly quizzes except 9 in one and a 32 out of 35 in my final exam. I worked so hard to do well in the course but unfortunately was given a 17 in the first peer assessment out of the total 23 which brought down the whole percentage.. Since this course has such a huge percentage allotted to peer assessment ( even more than the final exam)	 and there is no way of ensuring that everybody will be judged uniformly and fairly in these assignments	 a lot depending on not just how well the paper is written but who your paper went to for grading 	 I please please request you to either consider the weightage allotted to the peer assessment again or the bar that has been set for distinction...  Am sure there are some people who have been lucky in every way and will pass with distinction and am happy for them	 but for most of us peer assessment grades were a huge disappointment...</p>

"Dear Hal<br /><br />I take on board your rationale for not wanting the OLI to be downloadable and I certainly want to start by working my way through the sections and engaging in the interactive exercises - and I understand the educational benefits of this approach. However	 if I were to have a copy of a ""normal"" textbook	 I would be able to highlight sections	 put page markers into sections of particular interest	 take it with me to read in other locations	 at other times	 etc. The OLI does not allow for that	 and is much more cumbersome to navigate through than a normal book	 when wishing to re-read or reference a particular section etc.<br /><br />The OLI is great	 but not nearly as useful as a ""real""	 printed textbook. So	 as a compromise	 is there any way that the OLI could be set up such that each section was downloadable by a student only AFTER it had been accessed as intended?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />PS: I have only worked through the first four sections and have already had a number of errors on the interactive exercises.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> "

Let's hope it's not that they would never be willing to teach another course like this one	 because so many seem so ungrateful. Voice your critical thoughts	 people	 but	 please adopt a more positive approach. I work as a teacher myself and I know it's not always easy to make the right decisions and sometimes what is right to me may seem wrong to you. <br />Thanks for a great time and some insights that otherwise I would probably never have gained!

I'm going to give it a try to see if I can hone my study method into a highly efficient and effective style. Otherwise I will have to drop it and wait for it to be offered again. I really like the teaching method and am very	 very interested in the material. Hope I can figure out how to fit it in!

"When people is young	 we are strong and healthy	 ours brains work well.<br /><br />But some people take care of themselves	 they do exercise	 read	 etc	 meanwhile other people smoke	 drink	 take drugs	 etc.<br /><br />So after several decades of those different lifestyles	 the difference is more marked in older people than in younger people.<br /><br /><br />Two guys can score 100 of IQ when they are 20	 but when they are 60	 most likely the one who's taken care of himself will score more than the guy who's not taken care of himself.<br /> "
"Let me add my two cents here. Congrats to Anderson Smith and staff (and anyone else who participated in the realization of this course). I throughly enjoyed this course	 its videos	 its learning methods...everything really. I'm 57 yrs. old so it has been a while since I've done this kind of thing but was able to ""fall back"" into the groove gracefully thanks to coursera and you. I feel I must say something about the peer assessments. For myself	 I cannot complain but to see so much negativity in the forums set me back somewhat. May I ask	 is this something that happens every time with peer assessments or was this just a ""particular situation""? Eventually could this be detrimental to yours (or any others) course for that matter? <br />Anyway	 enough said. Keep up the good work and have a nice summer.<br /> "

"There is more to building fictional characters than describing physical attributes.  I am hoping to take what I learn from this class into the fiction world by embedding mannerisms and more specific behaviors that best fit the characters I am trying to develop.  Showing a characterâ€™s behavior issues will have a stronger impact on readers than simply saying that this person has this problem.

Aside for my hopes of incorporating knowledge of human behavior into my writing	 I believe the subject is interesting on its own.  So	 I am also studying psychology to satisfy my own curiosity. "

"Hi Everyone	
 My name is NAME2361328. I am in my early 40's and I am from and live as well  in California. I enrolled in this class because I would like to learn about the behaviors and reasons people act and do as they do	 I have a family history of mental illnesses	 my Mother is Schizophrenic and my Sister is Bipolar. I have been diagnosed with Social Anxiety. I have always been very shy and a bit insecure	 I think that's where my social anxiety comes from but I can be wrong. Thats why I am here	 to learn. Well good luck everyone with your learning and may the best be yet to come for you all. "

"I understand how the peer assessment works and I believe that they are a great learning tool. My issue with it in this course	 is that either the students grading are not sticking to the criteria or just doing it without reading.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here is why	 for example the last part of the assessment asks: Did the student say the data would be analyzed? I actually said it twice in my paper and got a big fat 0 on that part. In all others	 just an average of 3	 which leads me to believe that either a computer is automatically assigning grades with averages or students are just giving the mid grade for everything to get it done and over.<br /><br />I am spending quite a bit of time in this course	 and actually resent that students grading my paper are not taking the time to do so with a conscience.<br /><br />So please	 if you are taking part on the peer assessments	 take them seriously and read and grade according to the criteria	 or donÂ´t do it at all since that means you are wasting my time	 that of other students and that of the faculty putting this course together for us.

Congratulations for well organized course Mr. Smith and Mr. Alex! A big thank you for giving me/us a chance to learn psychology! I really enjoyed your course and learned a lot. I wish you all the best. 
"I guess there are a lot non academic people on this forum	 since bringing forward a flaw in the grading policy based on a factual point (inbalance in a cumulative exam)	 a lot of people do miss the point or miss the critical attitude.

Do you plan to offer some other psychology courses <br /> 
"See this whole plagiarism thing is way out of control and largely stems from the fact that the people who are inveighing against others don't themselves understand what plagiarism is.&nbsp; Because regardless of what they say	 their paper is NOT&nbsp; original.&nbsp; didn't they have to refer to experiments and research done by other persons? Because they didn't go and do any of that research	 so those persons who say they work off their butts (as if other persons didn't) but they work off their&nbsp; butts <i>to put the material in THEIR OWN WORDS! </i><b> THAT IS PLAGIARISM! </b>Because THEY are trying to pass off someone's work as their own.&nbsp; Other persons were more honest and say we got it from&nbsp; these sources!

Last but not least	 different people have different methods of learning	 some learn better by reading	 some learn better by doing	 some learn better by listening	 I'm sure some people will find that the videos left a more lasting impression in their minds than the OLI textbook	 simply because they are auditory learners.<br /><br />So to each his own	 it isn't a must to watch the videos. I believe watching the videos is recommended though. I appreciate the lecturer's and course&nbsp;coordinates'&nbsp;efforts on providing us with&nbsp;excellent&nbsp;course materials. Let's just make the best use of them. "
"&nbsp;This is the first time I have enrolled for an online&nbsp;program.<br /><br />I have a few questions regarding the OLI and lecture videos.&nbsp;<br /><ol><li>Do we need to have both the OLI text and the lecture videos or any one will suffice	 ( I have internet connection issues 	 so heavy downloading is a problem).</li><li>In the OLI text most of the chapters are already available.

"well that is exactly what I did:<br />''<span>Remarkably	 in this study about 76% of the 123 men who were tested gave at least one incorrect response when it was their turn	 and 37% of the responses	 overall	 were conforming. This is indeed evidence for the power of conformity because the participants were making clearly incorrect responses in public. However	 conformity was not absolute; in addition to the 24% of the men who never conformed	 only 5% of the men conformed on all 12 of the critical trials.</span>'' So	 it kind of is the idea I guess?

"Hi	&nbsp;the question maybe came from a lecture video	 not the OLI Textbook	 as the material is slightly different in both. "
"I was wondering if we can do something to revise or someone would assess again one of our assignments	 because in the first one I only got a 3 and I think this is not a fair grade. "
"Well	 this is not a issue	 but i think that the OLI textbook spend a lot of time	 i dont know how can we measure the time spent in the course but for me is taking too long for each module. "
"Hello professor and thank you for those nearly implacable lecture videos. I enjoyed every time you went off the book and made some personal reference	 comment	 joke or give an example. This helps me a lot to remember things and understand them ore deeply.

Reason being I'm not strong in either arts or programming. Upon one year after my graduation	 it dawned on me that I have been having a strong interest in reading psychology books. I started my first couple of books on Jung's and Freud's studies. Their studies might have been outdated after so many years but they still provide a pretty interesting read. I visited my ex-lecturer recently	 whom had also introduced Jung and Freud to me during my schooling years	 and he mentioned about Coursera to me. And ta-da	 here am I. Nice to meet everyone. :) "

I got a 23. I'm very happy with this! :) 
"I'm joining the ranks of the frustrated students here. The rubric used is very poor	 the whole peer assessment process made worse by the fact that there is no comment box to explain or even just give some additional feedback.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am in the process of marking my 2nd student and actually this is the worst of the 3 submissions I've got; the layout makes it very hard to read (all in one block	 no line breaks	 nothing)	 the actual experiment is more of a training exercise than a study/experiment	 some the independent variable is or can be easily confounded and there are more issues.&nbsp;<br /><br />None of these issues are adequately captured in the rubric we're using	 so I will end up giving this submission a pretty high mark	 simply because most of the criteria are met (correct phrases used etc). That the experiment doesn't make much sense from start to finish and that the variables can be so easily confounded somehow doesn't have any influence on my marking.&nbsp;<br /><br />Since it's not the students' (and that's all of us!) problem or fault that the marking rubric is not particularly good I won't be marking too strictly (if in doubt I will award the higher score) but I really	 really wish for that comment box	 so I could give some feedback to the student!&nbsp; "
"Question 1. No	 I don't think that you should know the evaluation criteria when writing the assessment. I think that was exactly the task: to find out	 what is important in a description of an experiment. It would have been too easy if you knew these criteria	 everybody could write something down and get full points	 without really understanding and without spending time on thinking on this topic.<br /><br />Question 2: Yeah	 I have the same problem: I have a very detailed description of an already realized experiment. So I don't think	 that was really written and thought alone. And I have another assessment	 where nearly all points were missing	 but you can see	 that somebody really thought about a good experiment. So I gave him as much points as the criteria allowed.<br /><br />Question 3: One possible answer is:

<p><i>""The indepedent variable is defined	 but term independent variable is not
explicitly called that.""</i></p><p>I would use that	 if the definition is not correct<i>. </i>So if he somehow described a independent variable	 but named it wrong	 it is for me the same point as if he hadn't give it a name at all.<i><br /></i></p>

I don't agree. But I didn't downvoted - or upvoted - the first message of this thread. Why? Anybody has the right to express his/her opinions.&nbsp; 
Always welcome to ask a question; someone should know the answer.&nbsp; Glad you were able to get it to work. 
"I checked	 it didn't matter with my score or any of the scores I tested since there are only two to be averaged. "
The very last lecture: there are a few quite specific questions about Alzheimer's in the exam. The most of the rest questions should be obvious if you did well on quizzes. I failed one question on Alz. and one on memory. :)<br /> 
"Phoebe	 thank you for your kind words of encouragement.&nbsp; "
"EMAIL25707 did	 just wondered if your answer was a simple as you tried to make it sound.&nbsp; I guessing from your refusal	 it is not. "

By the way what you are doing is not called 'proving' in science. You're making unverified accusations based on personnal assumptions and prejudice. 
"I fully agree Eva	 this is ""sick""... "
Maybe next time then. All this is a brand new world to me. 
"Javier	 I took Dan's course too and I fully agree	 especially after his comments about his ""best jokes"" (that I found pretty sick..). I didn't get the statement	 because of the assessment (just like here	 some peers were probably too lazy to read the whole work and gave me low grades). But did you see the Statement for that course? &nbsp;It states something about hanging this paper on your wall	 cause you deserve it	 which I think is pretty inappropriate (all the Statements I have lists the subject of that course	 logically...). <br />I've learned there some good stuff	 but in conclusion	 I'm bit dissapointed too. "
"Anonymous	 the passing depends ONLY on the peer assigment	 since you have 15 attemps at the quizes. Everybody scored 10 at the quizes	 (it's hard not to	 if you got 15 attemts) and all of a sudden you need 6/10 mÃ­nimum at the assigment to get the certificate. Many people with impressive assigments flunked	 hours and hours of effort and time wasted.<br /><br />And there was only one peer assigment	 so it's basically like throwing a coin. That &nbsp;course&nbsp;was not hard at all	 it was &nbsp;just about luck.<br /><br />Yes	 I agree the subject is fascinating	 and this guy is a good teacher	 but let's be real	 he's an attention seeker. "
"Because instincts can explain (partially) the motivation for human behavior	 but not the behavior itself. Because humans are much more than animals. Suppose my midbrain tells me to do XYZ according to Freudian or evolutionary instincts. But I have an entire cortex to guide my behavior and to control the impulses. "
"I can't remember where I read about the remark.<br /><br />If we managed to gather enough votes for your thread	 hopefully some staffs or Prof. Smith can look at it. Why don't you start a thread and help those students who received ridiculously low grades? I'll definitely help you to vote up your thread.<br /><br />Edit: I've emailed you.&nbsp;<br /> "
"I think most of us just give up	 because the most probable situation is that the grades are going to be low because they don't matches with the rubrics. For example	 with the ""<span>There should be a discussion of how knowledge of genes can be used to determine heritability</span>"" rubric	 that isn't mentioned in any of the works that I'm evaluating and neither in my own...<br />So I'm doing my best to be generous with the grades	 but truly I just gave up in a fair evaluation of the peer assignments. "
Okay troll. 
Thanks Hal. I understand your concern.<br /> 
"That's a load of crock	 anon. First off	 the course specifies that it expects forum participation. Second off	 the world is made up of several different types of people which is why we have guidelines on how to interact with each other. Most of us learn those unwritten rules as we grow up	 but obviously some people don't. OP's rudeness is in direct violation of societies rules and Christine has every right to feel bad about it. What I don't get is why some ignorant child is allowed to ruin this course for so many? The only thing I can comfort myself with is that peer assessments don't bother me. So while everyone else will be doing fine	 OP will be struggling and swearing and whining	 and I hate to admit it	 but after all the trouble that OP has caused for so many decent people	 that thought gets me off!! :-)<br /><br />Now in my opinion	 I think OP has been used to being the queen bee her whole life	 because she is smart. Probably the smartest of all her friends which would explain the bullying people to get her way. But the problem she's experiencing now is that she not the smartest person around anymore. Not by a long shot	 judging by all the intelligent posts you can find OTHER places in this forum. So now she's trying to deal with not being able to push everyone around and that just eats her up inside. So she lashes out with hateful comments. What she doesn't understand is that everyone sees her for what she is. And like you said Vallery	 at the end of the course	 we will have our certificates	 and OP will probably still be whining about how unfair it is. :-) OP	 no need to write a long winded response. Just skip to the part where I'm unintelligent etc... because seriously	 your posts just go on and on and on and on and on....<br /> "

"It was very clearly indicated in the Assignment section that when you 
submit your assignment	 you can make changes to it and re-submit it. It
 was also encouraged to submit early ""in case"" some technical difficulty would prevent you from submitting it at the last minute. So	 why wouldn't you submit it instead of saving it the first time you worked on it? Even if your work wasn't complete	 there would be 'something' instead of 'nothing' for your peers to evaluate.

I can not think of a situation where that could be objectionable. Ther is no doubt we all have laboured a lot as well as learnt a lot for / in this course. I am convinced the staff is not uncooperative at all. This solution might help some of us to cross the 90% line (distinction) and also at the same time	 not push anyone lower!

Yes. I'm on LinkedIn. But I am not that active there. How do I know which is you? There are so many people with your same name.&nbsp;

"Hi	 Sadia!<br />I think you should be more specific with your variables. Take your dependent variable. <i>The children</i> are your subjects. And you are studying something in the children	 namely their agression. The dependent variable is what you measure. What is it in your experiment? I think it's children's response to the frustrative situations (you may call it in other way).<br />And on your independent variable: you say it is cartoons but group B is exposed not to cartoons but to some other visual material. There is logical inconsistence here. :) My way out is to show children of group B <i>cartoons with non-violence content</i> (then we can say that ind. var. is the <i>type</i> of cartoons shown). You may think out something else.<br />I hope my speculations will be of help :D I wish you luck with the second assignment!<br /> "

"That would be fair	 because it was announced. The score of the first 10 questions in the final exam has to be considered as a quiz score. Eventually mistakes in these first 10 questions can be averaged out in the quiz scores and do not weight to heavly on the final exam (which is also counted for 30%) of the grand total of the number for grading.

"Your English is very clear. I don't think we'll get any answers from our Professor or Alex. Here are my thoughts	 but I'm just a student:<br />1)a I am using more than the OLI and lectures because&nbsp;I can get a lot more information that way.<br />1) b) I am including references to any source I use (including the OLI) because if I don't	 someone might accuse me of plagerism (copying someone else's work).<br />2) I am writing about both nature and nurture.<br />3) .It says to "" indicate how we collect data to address this issue."" To me that means not only talking expeiments that have been done	 but including other things (like observational studies) that have been done. <br />4) My conclusion includes both aspects because that is what is true&nbsp;for the choice I made.<br /><br />Consider these to be just my thoughts; you must do what is correct for you.<br /><br />I hope this helps. I'm sure there will be others who have different ideas. "
It is my hope that it is not considered cheating to look up the meaning of unfamiliar words.&nbsp; 
"Oh look	 OP has a friend. Maybe less abusive but definitely just as insulting!<br /> "
I think the system has some problem with the score. Thanks for the infomation.<br /> 
Good point Kathy! 
"Yes Alex	 but is it possible to consult the provided material DURING the quiz? Or is it considered as cheating? Must we memorize every name	 chronology and so on	 or are we allowed to consult OLI while answering the quizzes. ? "
"I think the peers assessing my assignment 2 could somehow got the point &amp; I did not lose marks for not having used&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;words 'cultural differences'.

"That is indeed quite great. Thanks for addressing the query	 Alex! "
"Anonymous	 thanks! Though I think economics is out of my current interests. :)<br /> "
Perhaps you missed out stating the total number of people you needed for the experiment and the part where data will be analysed.&nbsp;<br /><br />My guess is some marks are lost on the independent and dependent variables too because each student interprets the rubrics for that differently.&nbsp; 
"<p>Well	 yesterday I tried once more with a different Professor.  He gave me a name of his friend to write to him	 and said he would recommend me. Very nice of him! And he has done so	 indeed.

I totally agree with you about the cause of this evaluation distress. I think the staff should be made aware of your proposal so at least they can think of putting in a system that is more reliable. I am doing the signature track and i was quite happy with my assignment and still i got 18. It is more than 70% but i have serious doubts about the reliability of the evaluation process.&nbsp; 
"<p>This summer	 I was taking a Skype interview with a British Professor because I want to continue my education abroad. I don't have many job opportunities	 so I considered my self very lucky.

The Professor suggested to me to postpone the interview	 but I prefered to continue. I can't schedule when my neighbors fire and when they don't. The Professors eyes were unbelievable! British are self-controlled	 with marvelous sense of humor - but at that situation he looked exceptionally. 
Anyway	 he did not take me.

By the way you are the one lying because what you said was exactely that my poor grammar proved that I could not be an instructor or that I was a really bad one and that anyway I loosing all credibility. This is an insult diretly toward the fact English is not my native language. And you are the one posting anonymously so you can't be telling me I'm a coward ?! This posts will also be deleted shortly I just don't want to be associated to all that nonsense. 
"I scored more than 30 papers and two of them were ""2."" They were well written but did not have the things that were required. In fact	 neither was an experiment; they were both observations and said as much. There was no control group	 no dependent or independent variables	 and nothing measured. I think some students felt they should have a good grade	 not because of correct content	 but because they worked hard at what they did. As I said	 both of these papers were well written	 but they weren't experiments. "
"EMAIL25707 do wish for people to avoid taking their frustration out on assignment 2.&nbsp; I worry they might	 but I am hoping that we can be a little more mature than that. "
"You have a point. Having said that	 I would like to add that	 as the matter was urgent	 you should have subscribed to the thresd to get all updates. I n fact the automatic settings are such that and unless you uncheck it	 you are alresdy suscribed. I agree its easier to say as hindsight than foresee the problem. To conclude	 you do have a point and I am optimistic of the staff being very cooperative. "
And the student knows too.

"Is there a system of how the overall grade is calculated? I thought the instructors act independently. XD<br />Can you give a link or a name of a course fully relying on peer assessment? It is very interesting.<br /><br />I think the forms of assessment depend on the material(!)	 professor's approach to grading	 traditions	 professor's personality and many other things.

Haha!<br /><br />I hope Christine is around too. We shouldn't let the trolls (one specifically) get us down. Man	 what a jerk	 eh? I just stopped paying him any attention at all. It was fun to cross swords with him for a bit but then I realized that&nbsp;I barely have enough time to study and have a life too... and no time to waste on meaningless mock battles. There was one course I simply didn't have time to take but I gathered up all the videos and quizzes and notes and such and will take it on my own later if it isn't offered again. I'm feeling greedy like I know this won't stay free forever. I may have to simply gather the Camera class too.<br /><br />I'm thinking this is the creme of the crop course on Psychology so unenrolled myself from some of the others for now.

I have her email but I wanted to give her space so I'll try when the course is over and say ""Hi"" from you!&nbsp; I did good on my assignment as well	 but I still don't like them. Especially when there aren't any concrete guidelines for which my peers can judge me. My thoughts on fx. intelligence may not be the same as others and vice versa. When there's so much riding on the results (12 weeks of tight deadlines	 late nights and hard work) I think it's appalling that there is so little ""support"". There is a course that has just started	 The Social Context of Mental Health and Illness. Very informative course and Professor Williams takes the course seriously. She's the Dean (I think	 or assistant Dean) of University of Toronto as well as a professor	 but she still takes the time to make video messages explaining exactly what she is expecting so no one feels unfairly treated. You might want to check it out. I highly recommend the course! Good luck in your last assignment	 I hope it works out well for you!! :-)<br /> "
I care about her Masters. 
"Hola Antonio	 no se si entendi bien tu consulta. Pero en terminos generales	 las actividades del curso son las siguientes:

2. Material de lectura.
3. Quizes Semanales.
4. 2 Proyectos (ensayos)
5. Examen final.

Espero esto te aclare tu duda.

"I reversed it and asked myself to what aspects of psychology does the nature vs. nurture debate apply? Then I searched the internet for ""Aspects pf Psychology."" I won't tell you what I concluded they are because I could be wrong! But - it's a good way to at least consider some ideas. "
Thank you professor. 
"I appreciate it for what it is. An opportunity to learn.

And really who cares about US laws. I have the opportunity to learn about Psychology as a science	 the material is good	 the overall experience is good	 what is the point of chasing down peer assessments? I like them	 you don't like them. The ones who decide like them.

Why do you feel the need to make it exactly as you like it	 and not as the owners like it?

Maybe you lost the analogy; the apple tree is for the kids to eat apples. You just want the neighbor to offer oranges because YOU like oranges.

In your opinion	 it is counter-productive. In my experience	 it helps a lot; the system has a way to zone out the people who just want to make a fuss. The rest of us grade with consideration and learn from the experience.

Maybe if you appreciated it more you would spend more time studying and less time trolling about legitimacy. "

Thanks Hari for your quick response. 
"i did not use to words to specify what we were supposed to but thought i included everything.<br />really thought about this hard to and thought that the idea was a great one.<br />you can reply to me at EMAIL15356 /><br />see attached:&nbsp;<br /><p>My experiment using the Experimental Method of Psychology
includes Dogs and the way they respond to training behaviors.&nbsp; The test is to train and train a dog to
listen to your commands and when they do reward them with something and if they
do not listen to let them know they did not do it correctly and	 discipline
them.&nbsp; The disciplining should not be
that severe that the dog begins to dislike you.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>How the test goes is like this:</p>

<p>If you are trying to House Train your dog there are many
ways of doing this.&nbsp; You give them a few
chances because if this is brand new to them to stop doing something they need
to become aware of this.&nbsp; When the dog is
a puppy or brand new to the house they are not aware of where to go to the
bathroom.&nbsp; The best thing to do is the
following:</p>

<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Get puppy pads and let them know where it is.</p>

<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Get a
Cage and let them be aware of the cage.</p>

<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A person should be taking their pet out a few
times each day to let them know and get trained on the times they must go out
and that they are supposed to go outside to the bathroom</p>

<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If the dog goes to the bathroom on the floor you
must discipline them and let them know that this is wrong and say NO.&nbsp; </p>

<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When the dog is getting walked and goes potty
outside a person must reward them with a treat and let them know this is the
correct thing to do.</p>

<p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If the dog does not listen about going on puppy pads
inside or to stop going inside and they go to better assist with the
disciplining then the dog must be put inside the cage and let them know that
this is wrong.</p>

<p>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When the dog listens in the house they must get
rewarded also so they know that what they are doing is correct.</p>

<p>Another Training Task would try with chewing on things:</p>

<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To start a puppy teethes just like babies do and
also likes to play constantly like babies do so they will try to chew on things
when they are trying to strengthen their teeth or playing.</p>

<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The best thing to do is purchase a lot of toys
and chewing toys at the beginning.</p>

<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
They must know that these things are what they
are supposed to be chewing on and not furniture	 clothing like socks and other
things.</p>

<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first time you see them start chewing/biting
on furniture tell them NO and let them know this is wrong.</p>

<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A person should give the dog the chewing treats
and chewing toys when they are chewing on other things and take away the other
stuff.</p>

<p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another thing that should be done is when a dog
is chewing on things they must get disciplined by tapping the top of the dogs
mouth so that they know that they are not supposed to be chewing on whatever
they are.</p>

<p>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When a dog is chewing on their toys and chewy
treats you should let them know that this is the correct thing to be chewing on
and not anything else.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These two training tasks for dogs are very important when
having a pet.&nbsp; This is an experiment that
I decided to do because a lot of times depending on how a dog is born do not
have to be trained on this.&nbsp; So another
part of the experiment could be test dogs that come from different places.&nbsp; For example	 a dog that comes from a store
which is surrounded by people compared to a dog that comes from a breeder who
is only surrounded by the humans that breed them and their other pets.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to experience both of these situations
with my two shelties.&nbsp; My little girl	
Casey <img src=""src"" alt=""image"" /></p>

<p>We bought from a pet store and she was in there for 6 months
before we brought her home.&nbsp; When we
brought her home she was disciplined and house broken for the most part. Sadly
we had to put her to sleep this past August 11th.</p>

<p>Secondly	 then we bought another Sheltie named Cody	 <img src=""src"" alt=""image"" />from a breeder.&nbsp; It was amazing how because we had Casey in
the house already Cody was brought into the house and trained himself in a
short time period watching Casey.&nbsp; Cody
though we brought home at 7 weeks so he chewed on socks.&nbsp; He thought these were toys so we had to train
him that unless they are torn they are not toys.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Training an animal is a very important thing to do when you
take responsibility on having them.&nbsp;&nbsp; It
is an experiment to see how animals behave depending on their surroundings and
where they come from.&nbsp; Also rewarding
your pet is very important because letting them know they are doing the correct
things will make them better pets.</p> "

"Hi again Christine<br />The outline says ""two written assignments"" but does not specify them as being psychology projects	 per se (unless I missed something). As I mentioned before	 I see computer-marked assignments as being the only sensible and equitable way to assess this number of students. Some of the Coursera courses use a variety of methods for doing this (identification of labels on diagrams	 fill-in-the-blanks etc.) in addition to straight multiple choice questions - so there can be quite a rich and comprehensive assessment process without resorting to peer assessments of dubious validity.<br /><br /> "

"I am finding it hard to concentrate on the OLI as well	 and most of them	 going through it late at night	 which takes up my sleep	 and does affect my work a bit.

That way	 those with less time to study	 can just go through the videos	 and those who prefer the OLI texts can supplement as well.

"With one exception	 all of the papers I've graded mentioned what they planned to do with the data (using all of the words you can imagine	 besides word 'analyze') and they got to score 3 :-) I was aware of the fact that the professor himself wrote in one of the threads that students should write 'the data will be analyzed'	 but not everybody read that	 unfortunately. The name of the thread is 'Need help on experiment'. Nevertheless	 I didn't write 'the data will be analyzed' hahaha<br /> "
"hello Maria Dias	
your question has no relation to the post made by Anonymous	 this threat is about Inquiry
the Announcements page has your answer	 be carefull to don't miss that page as there is where the announcements on the course are made
still	 in that page they say:
""Quizzes will be open from 8:00 am (EDT) on Friday of each week until 8:00 am on the following Friday. For example	 Week 1's quiz will be open from 8:00 am on March 29 until 8:00 am on April 5. This gives you a week to complete each quiz.""
ou seja	 tens uma semana para fazÃª-lo "
"Well	 now you've had your say OP	 do you feel better now? Because me	 I don't really care. This entertains me. Call me a freak	 but it does. As I mentioned	 I'll be getting my certificate	 so it's all good! :-) <br /> "
"Hi	 Andi! It is wow what you are doing there	 in Budapest. You just studied psychology? How did you began to work with homeless people? Do you work with an organization	 or something like that? "
"Hi!! My name is NAME2904996	 I'm 22 years old and I am from Colombia. I'm a professional actress and I want to do a major in Dramatherapy	 so that's why I entered this course. I think that you must understand the human brain and behavior before you can help anybody through therapy	 which is my goal. I'm thrilled to see so many people from different countries	 ages and backgrounds interested in understanding each other a little bit better :) "
"Oh dear... looks like we've done gone pissed some antisocial loser off. Oh well	 I'm a big girl	 I can handle a couple of big	 bad old down votes. Haahahahaha!! Just a little message to the poor little baby that voted me down. Take a look through my past posts... ""Frankly	 my dear	 I don't give a damn!!"" As for you	 Javier	 you sexy boy you	 I'm starting to enjoy this bantering!!&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; BTW I don't speak Norwegian. LOL <br /> "
Thanks Harry!<br />I really appreciated your comment.<br /> 
I do not think you can be successful by just watching the videos.&nbsp; You must read from the text.&nbsp; My first quiz was late because I missed the deadline.&nbsp; Let us see how best we can catch up.<br />

"Professor Smith is a great guy	 I noticed two important details about him in the lectures.<br /><br />First: in the first week	 he noticed right away that the girl who was gonna undergo an fmri scanner had a metal botton on her shoulder...not even the assistant with her metal detector noticed it. Professor showed a sharp eye.<br /><br /><br />Second: he had no problem admitting most people in his backround was racist when he was a kid (he was born in the deep rural &nbsp;South)	 an he had to ""unlearn"" this when he grew up. Not many people is so frank and honest about negative stuff in their past. I really admire that type of people who is not afraid to face reality.<br /><br /><br />This course is the first on coursera where I get&nbsp;the certificate 	 so I will always remember it in a special way.<br /><br /> "
"I fully agree with you. There are some negative people on this forum	 who don't realize that this course is for free and a great opportunity to learn something. A lot of people only nag about grading etc. No my cup of tea.<br /> "
I apologize for the remark I made earlier about Prof. Smith adding videos to the OLI to make a course.&nbsp;I was so frustrated with the lack of direction on Assignment 2 that I faulted him for something that he should not have been faulted for. I got to thinking - most professors use someone else's textbook - there's nothing wrong with that.It's standard practice. I was wrong.<br />Mea culpa!<br />Mea culpa! 
Thank you<br /> 
"I think the OLI Text only refers to major cultures like nationality	 race	 religion	 or gender.&nbsp; There are issues of smaller cultures influencing disorders as urban dwellers	 impoverished souls	 or individuals that live in highly restrictive environments (prisons or institutions) show a higher risk in developing symptoms of schizophrenia	 which supports that some (small) culture environments can contribute to the disorder. "
3rd student: no mention of reducing confounding e.g keeping experimenter/ primer constant etc.<br />guess what?............that's right another high mark<br /> 
"I know	 I've noticed that too. It's the ""unbalanced one""	 I'm sure!! About the question	 yes	 I was hoping that but I wanted to make sure. Thanks for answering.&nbsp; :-)<br /> "
"Nancy	 sorry to burst your bubble	 but you havenÂ´t paid anything at all...<br /><br />Most coursera courses have written assiments	 if you donÂ´t like it you can hit the road. "
"And another thing: what does the phrase ""to what <b>ASPECTS </b>of psychology does it apply""? schools of psychology?!&nbsp; "
"Sowmya	<br /><br />My information.<br />There is no minimum word limit. Alex confirmed it. Mine finished in 500 words.<br />Instructions do not speak about references. If authentic	 it may be mentioned superfluously.<br />Rationale for choosing the experiment is a must.<br />As regards Analysis	 I share your view. Since we stop with the design	 there is no possibility of seeing results and analyzing them. However	 Manipulation of the Independent Variable and its expected impact on the Dependent Variable has to be given.<br /><br /> "
"I took that course and enjoyed it. We had to read a lot of experiments done by behavioral economists and that helped me immensely for assignment for this course!<br /><br />At the end	 I was disappointed with the Statement of Accomplishment itself - the words seemed somewhat offensive to all the work all the students have put into this class.<br /> "
"Javier	<br />Just in case you don't know	 there is a object that looks like a wheel to the right of your name on the post. Click on it and a drop down menu will give you a choice between edit or delete. Click on edit. You may have to scroll down to your entry again. Then you can delete the offending word (consider this request #3). When&nbsp;you are finished	 click on the ""update post"" box on the bottom left of your comment box.<br />Thank you.&nbsp; "
At 91.9% it shows for me too. 
"Anon	 easy way to know if someone plagiarized: Google a sentence	 and if you find exactly the same sentence on the web	 it's straight-up plagiarism. There's no analysis there and it goes against every academic standard. There's no need to be so furious	 I'm starting to think you're one of the plagiarists... "
"OP the more you write the easier it will be to recognize your peer assignment. You've pissed off a lot of people. No wonder you're afraid. What goes around comes around. Instead of trying to get rid of the peer assessments	 maybe you should try being nice. "
"you know	 there could be optional videos	 only for those -since many of us aren't English native speakers but trying to ""fit in""- who want that extra example on a meaning or terminology! "
mpes sto thread tis eftichias GREEK STUDY 
Prof Smith has linked OLI Text to go with his Video Lectures in order to give the benefits of LNAME487897D and DIGT. My wish is that he could add some text from his research material wherever OLI text is falling short.<br /> 
I already suggested that!!&nbsp; :-) <br /> 
I am 36 years old my step daughter just turned 28 so my husband and I are like step grandparents but closer then real. MBA very easy go to whatever university you want and enroll to go get MBA. Email me directly if you need any other help. I am  with anonymous conversation over and done with. 
Where did you check it?<br />I didn't find my final grade or my passing percentage. 
"Hi Sehba	<br />I had the same problem but fortunatly I could solve:<br />Do not click on ""Week 6"" as usual	 but click on the button ""Quizzes"". There you can find the link and go through the quizz	 which I already did today.<br />Good luck	<br />Nam "
"Hey	 Helcio! Don't be&nbsp;dishearten! I've read your experiment and it's really detailed down to the last aspect of analysing too.&nbsp;<br /><br />I would daresay you merely need to add this<br /><br />""Independent variable:<div>Type of music (characteristic of a country) beind played.</div><div><br /></div><div>Dependent variable:</div><div>Number of items (from the same country as the music) bought by costumers.</div><div><br /></div><div>Number of subjects:</div><div>100 customers.""<br /><br />and a research hypothesis to get 20+.<br /><br />I literally get pissed off when someone gave me a really short description of their experiment when I was marking. And I felt unfair that the person ends up scoring more than you because he/she filled in whatever was in the rubrics. I understand that coming up with the description of the experiment takes up much more effort than what you didn't get marks for in your grades.<br /><br />Sadly	 the question for written assignment 1 did say ""You should have an independent variable that is not confounded and you should measure behavior."" While I was browsing the forum after I had submitted my assignment	 I noticed a student pointing out that we should state our independent and dependent variables too and I quickly went to altered it.<br /><br />Just remember	 the results you got is a reflection of what the students think is right and what the lecturers think you should have learnt. It didn't mean that your experiment is not good. If you ever have to write an experiment again for whatever reasons	 I hope you can put in your best like you did for this written assignment. Just thought I should spur you on from my end of the world since we have the same interest. :)</div> "
You're welcome!<br /> 
"I agree Kathy	 for me this process is about learning and not about proving that I can be lucky enough to win a grading lottery!<br /> This is a great class	 very informative	 but if we are going to put in all of this effort toward a certificate	 we should be graded fairly and not pass or fail simply by the luck of the draw.<br />I understand and appreciate that this is a free course	 and that I am learning a great deal by taking it. However I have taken many other OLI courses that did not offer certification	 and I participated&nbsp;just for the knowlege.<br />I took interest in courcera&nbsp;classes&nbsp;for the&nbsp;possiblity of receiving certification showing&nbsp;that I put in the time and effort	 and that I learned the material.<br />I considered paying for the upgraded certification but I&nbsp;decided to test the system out first. <br />Although I am still passing this class at this point dispite the poor assessment	&nbsp;I am&nbsp;glad that I didn't pay for this	 I dont think these certificates are going to mean very much to anyone.<br />&nbsp; "
Thx so much for sharing Anna... 
"I don't think there are trolls in this case. I think that it's set up so that if you did not submit a paper	 you cannot evaluate papers. "
"The Irrational Behavior course &nbsp;is based on the studies that claim people do irrational stuff	 specially in terms of economy and choices. It's all about psycholoy	 very interesting stuff. "
"EMAIL27764 Font""&nbsp; The following is the assignment details:<br /><b>""Using the experimental method	 design a psychology experiment on any topic you choose. Use all the information you learned about what a good experiment involves. You should have an independent variable that is not confounded and you should measure behavior. Donâ€™t worry about originality but do not simply copy another personâ€™s experiment. Come up with your own. Describe your experiment clearly in less than 1	400 words.</b><br /><br /><b>Do not be concerned about the quality of your research question. Be simple. We are interested in your answer having all the components of a good experiment. Define your terms and be explicit. Someone should be able to do your experiment exactly from your description.""</b><br /><br />Where does it say that the assignment must say the words ""the data will be analyzed""?&nbsp; I do not see the validation in your statements.&nbsp; "
"Actually	 it existed in Latin the same way it exists in mondern English	 it is a loan from Greek.&nbsp;<span style=""color: #ZIPCODE3;"">Of course there are many words that are the other way around	 as all languages ""borrow"" words for other languages.&nbsp;It is a common misconception that Latin and Greek have common linguistic roots; they belong in different language branches.</span><br /><br />My point isn't that a Greek word isn't getting ""recognition""	 obviously. It's like saying ""<i>cocoa originates from the Latin word 'caca</i>o'""	 when we all know it's a Mayan word.&nbsp;<br /><br />But I have to say it is easy for me to learn some technical words that people find difficult	 because I already know what they mean.&nbsp;I guess French people (for example) have the same advantage over me with Latin words.<br /> "
"I just deal with this assessment work as an informal essay	not a paper...it is my fault &nbsp;that I had not cited or referenced. but &nbsp;just &nbsp;state some fact as well as I list the the attitude of various psychologists.&nbsp; "
"Yes	 you are right... If I'm not mistaken	 control group was mentioned in one of the grading rubrics (but I can't see them now to confirm this). <br /> "
"Regarding the evaluation	 this comes from the Week 1 schedule page:<br /><br />""Pretest<br />Please complete the <a title=""Link: https://class.coursera.org/psy-001/quiz/start?quiz_id=53"" target=""_self"" href=""https://class.coursera.org/psy-001/quiz/start?quiz_id=53"">Pretest</a> before watching Lecture Video 1.2. It will not count towards your grade.""<br /><br /> "
"Hi Chananya	 great to find so many of us here who work with kids! I once spent a few months working on a summer camp in Connecticut	 it's such a beautiful state. <br /><br />It sounds like you have a lot of experience of applied psychology. I also 'switched' fairly recently	 in my case from research (including into anxiety disorders). I liked research	 but working in a school is so much more rewarding. Enjoy the course! "
thank you Christine&nbsp;<br /><br /> 
"Actually	 I'm not talking about the deadline	 and I just mentioned the language as a<span>n extra difficulty. I j</span>ust&nbsp; want to know&nbsp;if it's possible to have another test for those who	 like me	 reached the final grade below	 but nearly 7. "
"Maximum score is 23	 so 18 is still above 70%. "
"I don't know if I'm lucky with the second assignment yet. Maybe I'll get perfect zeros. :D<br /><br />You compare the course with the one run at the university	 and I - with digging Wikipedia or other Internet resources. And what does it mean? Misconceptions	 lack of discipline	 inconsistency. Coursera provides feedback	 deadlines and coherent knowledge.<br /><br />Still the rubric is bad. :P<br /> "
<span>Thankfully the deadline has been extended by 24 hours &amp; the system now shows my previously submitted final exam &nbsp;having been accepted for grading. I knew the course staff is not inconsiderate! Thanks a tonne Dr. Alex sir.</span> 
Hahaha!! <br /><br /> 
Thanks a lot Professor. It is clear now.<br /> 
"I just don't get	 how you can't get	 that it would decrease the quality of the whole course and of your learning... you're clearly obsessed with getting high marks and recognition and not learning things for your own personal development. "
"Dragana	 you have a very good point! I never thought about that. But now that you've called it to my mind I remember one of my aunties disowned her son because of it. "
"I am also frustrated that I could not submit my written assignment. I have been very diligent with this course and have not missed a deadline for a quiz or assignment and my grades overall average out to well over 90/100	 including the assignment 1.<br /><br />I tried to submit through Firefox	 and it would not let me cut and paste my Microsoft word document.<br />I then went to Internet Explorer and tried to submit it that way. It let me cut and paste my document but everytime I clicked the submit button	 Internet explorer unexpectedly closed/crashed. My assignment was done and ready to submit at 4 PM EDT and I tried for almost an hour and still no luck.<br /><br />Finally	 I tried one last time to submit it and it went through	 except it was about 4 or 5 minutes late by that time. Has there been a glitch in the coursera system or too much traffic at the time.<br /><br />I've put too much time and effort into this course to just throw it away because the coursera submission page would not accept it.<br /><br />I would appreciate it if you could look into this and find where the problem occurred. Please do not just give me the standard	 canned response that you are sorry I had problems with the submission but there is nothing you can do about it. Given all of the past submissions (quizzes	assignment 1) going through without any problem whatsoever	 I find it difficult to believe that the problem was with my browser/computer all of the sudden and lasted for over an hour.<br /><br />Thank you for your consideration in resolving this matter.<br /><br />Nancy<br /> "
"Instead	 how about ""Thinking Required"".&nbsp; "
"Well put	 Suzanne. Helcio	 I found your experiment to have all the components asked for except for the analyzing part. It appears that it was expected we both have the word analyzing and the results. I got voted down on that	 too. Otherwise	 good job. :-)<br /> "
"<p>Katherina	</p><p>It sounds like you may have been the victim of one of those people who sign up for a course just to create problems for everyone else. They have no intention of learning - they just cause trouble.</p><p>You may have lost a certificate	 but don't let it

"I don't mean to offend	 and I really really don't	 I have no more energy to give this course	 but either we're talking about 2 different questions or I just had a stroke and don't understand the written language anymore! Did you go into the quiz and read the question? I don't think it can be answered by what you're saying. However	 at this point	 my brain is pretty fried	 I'm in the middle of final exams for several other courses	 and mostly because it'll never be adressed	 I have moved on. I don't care anymore!! But I genuinely thank you for taking the time to try and help!  :-)

"Hello everyone! My name is NAME2166934 and I am a student at Saint Louis University in St. Louis	 Missouri (USA). I am pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology. I am very interested in the field of psychology and hope to learn a lot from this course! "

"that's right	 for example	 the receptive fields on video ""4 - 3 - Lecture Video 3.3 Receptive Fields"" are not in OLI and it was in the quiz	 and there are other differences. I don't think OLI was written by professor Smith	 because if it was it would be more matching :) so	 with those differences it gets really important to study the OLI and the videos	 or you can be missing things that will even be asked on the quiz. "
Cute answer. The truth is I almost got sucked in too because there is another thread for favorite quotes. I wonder if this thread is actually a research project to see how many people notice? 
"That's where you are wrong. These forums are public forums and open for everyone taking this course. If you have an issue with the course plan	 you should take it up with the professor	 not in the public forums. Couldn't you find his email address? Or wasn't there enough attention for you	 in a private email? No	 I don't think you want this problem solved	 you just want the attention.&nbsp; <br /> "

"The thing about posting on here is that you cannot upvote your own comments. You have posts that agree with you	 that haven't been voted up (because you can't) and you have only 1 down vote on comments going against you. It's not inconclusive evidence but it's enough for me	 and that's all I need to know. You may have everyone else fooled	 but not me. Just a thought though	 not once did you deny. For example ""My use of grammar? Two different individuals know how to articulate their opinion thus they must be one and the same?"" No denial	 just your continuous flood of smart aleck retorts. <br /> "
I assessed a paper that copied from OLI or Wikipedia as well.&nbsp; In some instances they changed a couple words per sentence.&nbsp; I grade them according to Alex's request (stated above) and try to keep in my mind that they at least know enough about the subject to copy the correct information.&nbsp; 
"I just finished Synapses	 etc... too. Well	 kind of. When I'm finished my paper I'll take the final. I absolutely loved Idan!! He explained it in a way that I had a chance of understanding because I agree with you that it was very hard. But he would use the term	 and then use an alternative expression. Kind of dumb it down for us.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; However the week where Guy was in charge I found very difficult. I had lots of problems understanding him and his use of ""uh"" every 3rd word was very exhausting. All in all though	 a great course and yes	 I'm waiting for the chance to be brilliant in conversation as well!! <br /> "

"<p>Alex	 thank you for your response!   </p>
<p>But these ""evaluators"" (including me) are currently devising various interpretations of rubric criteria all over the forum	 and I'm very much afraid that what eventually will be assessed will be far from what was intended.<br />If a student failed to include one of the points in his or her work it's probable that he or she doesn't understand the related conceptions. Can the criteria be explained in more details? As for me	 I'm having difficulties with the meaning of ""There should be a discussion of how cultural differences can be used to determine heritability"". How can they?<br /></p>
<p>And some people feel very reluctant to punish a good work even if some points were missed. If the rubric had additional scales	 something like ones that Holly suggested <a target="""" href=""https://class.coursera.org/psy-001/forum/thread?thread_id=1339"">here</a>	 they would allow evaluators to be more objective with the main criteria.  </p>

"What I AM in control of	 is making sure this doesn't happen to unsuspecting students the next time they try to post this course!<br /> "
"I would have a problem with that. Intelligence in itself is not a behavior	 and we were specifically asked to measure a change in behavior. I really wonder how any experimental design would be able to manipulate a person's intelligence? Sure	 you can manipulate people into behaving in a more or less intelligent way. But manipulating intelligence itself? Unless your experiment involves lobotomies and the like	 I have a hard time understanding how an experiment would be able to change a person's intelligence.<br /> "
EMAIL27764 they don't have tens of thousands of students in a classroom either so the peer assessment is the best they have. I was involved in University peer assessment and it is a part of most professional 360 evaluation so what is your point exactly<br /> 
"Yo JohnBoy	 it IS a violation when you are going against the wishes of the course leader. It is written in the announcements that if you encounter plagiarism you are to grade the paper as if there were none. Direct order	 buddy. A violation of that is a violation of the Honor Code. Again	 not YOU running this course so it doesn't really matter what you think! "
"Agreed Annette. I was very unsatisfied with my grade	 but I don't hold the reviewers accountable at all. For example	 I don't even understand why one of the grading criteria was to say explicitly that data would be analysed. Does that add to the quality? Does anyone really think you measure without analyzing results? What is the value added of explicitly	 rather than implicitly	 asserting it? I know data must be analysed	 I even said how - but in fact I didn't write down the expression ""data will be analysed"". So	 my reviewers gave me a zero in that criterion. And they were correct. The problem is that the grading rubic was not available beforehand (that's a first in all Coursera courses I took part in so far)	 and that the items in it are highly doubtful. "
Not enough people reacted the first time you posted that?<br /> 
"I'm not complaining Khaos	 just stating the obvious to me/us about what Ann suggested: that it is not quite simple to JUST ""<span>do exactly as is asked in the description of the assignment"". To me it's very important to read and understand what others did step by step	 so I can do it myself MY WAY	 without feeling that someone else really did it for me. That's that.</span> "
"Of course	 you are right when you say that it was equally applied to every student. That principel of equality. My point is that it is inconsitent to have a <i><b>cumulative </b></i>final exam and give one week material (week 12) a relative frequency in the questions of 34% (sic). That is not a cumulative final exam. <br />Further	 I did not read in the announcements that the week 12 material was more important than other materials. I don't agree if the staff would think that. <br />The inconsistency is that week 12 material weights for 34% x 0.3 in the final grade and that the material of the other weeks only for 12% x 0.3 in the final grade. Why is that the case?<br />It is further inconsistent to give multiple attemps for quizzes in week 1-11 and not for the first 10 questions covering week 12 in the final exam.<br />It is also inconsitent to give the right to drop the lowest quizz score from the quizzes covering week 1-11 and not for the week 12 material in the final exam.<br />We can fairly assume that all the materials from every week have the same importance for the course outcome. It was never announced that e.g. cognition was more or less important than e.g. abnormal behavior. So	 why is it then that week 12 gets so much weight in the final grade. What is the reason that the material of week 12 was treated in another (inequal) way?<br />The announcements from the staff doesn't entail an answer to this question. <br /> "
"P.S. Although I've never reported it	 I could not watch also the video with the limo and the stunt on behave of that TV show	 in Australia was it? "
"EMAIL25707 could you quote that information from the OLI	 it might help us with assignment #2. "
"DamiÃ¡n	 see what Alex says: ""If a student plagiarizes for the written assignment	 that is his or her loss. If you suspect a student has plagiarized his or her assignment	 still evaluate it using the rubric provided. At the very least	 if a student who has plagiarized receives a good grade	 it means that he or she at least understands the elements necessary for a valid experiment"".- Alex.&nbsp;<i style=""color: rgb(51	 51	 51);"">Fri 17 May 2013<br /></i>I'm a student not the professor (and so are you	 I guess) so I'm going to score the content	 even if it comes -copy &amp; paste- from a text. Good luck to everyone!! and happy end of the course.&nbsp; "
"You may have a point there. The final is more heavily weighted per question. But has anyone considered the implications of removing the first 10 questions from the final and allocating them to a Quiz 12?&nbsp; This could <b>reduce many people's final exam score by 1 point	</b> but make no impact on the Quiz average. I checked it with mine.&nbsp; <b><i>Who wants to reduce their overall mark</i></b>? Show of hands .!!! . Everyone can recalculate their marks as per the suggestion (separating the first 10 questions and allocating to quiz 12). and then respond. So I am not in favor of changing the rules to placate some people who may not have done as well in the Final as they had hoped. I say let the rules stand equally to all.<br /> "
"Well	 I DID understand instructions perfectly	 but there were no specific instructions on who we were writing for and no evaluation indications on what data they needed except for the variables and hypothesis. I established all variables and hypothesis	 but did not specify the amount of people the study should be applied to (because an expert would know the minimum valid number of participants for a psychological experiment to be valid is 51) or mentioned the data should be analysed	 because what would the aim of an experiment if you are not planning to analyse the data?? It is just too obvious.&nbsp; "

"Okay	 let me write this slowly	 so you can keep up this time	 because it's already been brought up. We are asked to do a PSYCHOLOGY paper	 talking about things that have been around for a couple of 100 years in some cases. Psychology is a subject where experiments	 surveys	 and studies happen all the time. To think that you can write a paper without repeating something that has already been said and done is asinine! There is only so much NEW data you can use	 and in some cases	 such as THIS paper	 it is impossible not to copy some information because that's all ANY of us are really doing here... finding research and putting it in our own words. Do you get it now??? BTW	 love the way you are ignoring that Kathy found your sentence to be plagiarized. Typical	 know it alls like you always ignore what doesn't fit with the facts as THEY see them. The FACTS are STILL	 do as you are told	 not as you want!! Was that slow enough typing for you?<br /> "
"I commend you	 Kathy. My whole point is that the answer to the question is a term we did not learn in the video or the OLI. So how could they expect us to guess a ""made-up"" term on a test. No teacher does that. When they accidently DO do it	 they rectify the situation. Even if you google the term	 you get other people asking about the term	 but it is not used in any definitions online. "
"Thank you professor	 I understood the point after the explanation	 but also	 because some questions are meant to see how well we understood	 we have to read them with a lot of attention and don't be precipitated... I learned to read the questions word by word very carefully and not by what I think at first hand the question wants to ask.<br />Well it's just a learn by doing exercise so	 no problem :)<br /><br />by the way	 I would like to point also that the OLI is meant for american/english native students	 for example	 for foreign students the words we memorize in the exercises are not so easy	 specially if we are not familiarized with them	 or the coins for example	 for me at least	 of course I wouldn't know witch one was real	 for basketball players	 I didn't know what is the basketball batting something so I failed the question lol	 it's ok	 we get it anyway	 I'm just remembering that some things will not work for everybody :)<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />ps - I just passed other good example of this on Learn by doing in page 98	 some I have a notion of the severity	 others even with&nbsp;dictionary&nbsp;I couldn't find the difference	 it was translated with the same words	 so I had to experiment 3 of them to find witch fits :( this is just an observation as I think this kind of exercise can't be different.

"Thanks HARI.&nbsp;I didn't think about the question from that perspective. Yet	 I don't see how your example can really describe the question. Lets say that the natural son of a traditional family of farmers is secretly interchanged with the son of a family of doctors. Will <i>the intelligence explained <b>by genetics</b></i> in those two babies change	 compare to the case that they would have never being swapped? I don't think so.<br /><br />A different question is whether there is an influence of culture into mate choice for procreation. There I do think can be a relation. I can imaging that in a culture where high talented musicians could only married other high talented musicians	 those naturally belonging to that family would show in average high natural intelligence for music.<br /><br /> "

How would anyone know that they are talking about a term called ""public conformity""? Could just as well be ""power conformity"" because they used those words too. Like I said	 you won't find the term ""public conformity"" in our OLI because it isn't there!<br /> "
Hey!!!! I am Spanish too. So let me know if you need any help with the English ;)<br />I really hope we can get to know each other. What do you do for a living?<br />NAME3124335 
Glad I could help! Congratulations on the certificate! 
"Sarah--that is how it is suppose to go.&nbsp; It is possible to get whole numbers.&nbsp; Example:&nbsp; if you got 5	 5	 3	 3	 that is a total of 16 which is divided by the four peers 16/4=4.&nbsp; Some students in threads reported getting only a 1 or a 2 for a total score	 so it is possible someone was grading zeros in all areas.&nbsp; Although	 some scores seem extremely suspicious	 we have not way to argue the validity of the scoring...guess we are stuck with what we get and without knowing how it happened. "
"Wow	 Kathy	 a million thanks	 I suck at numbers	 just reading your explanation I felt dizzy	Lol.<br /><br />Well	 It looks I made it....my first coursera certificate. I was close with Gamification and Introduction to Irrational Behavior but the assigments blew it in the last second.<br /><br /><br />This course has been really special	 I am gonna really miss it	 thanks.<br /><br /><br />YEEEEPPPEEEEEEEE.<br /><br /><br /> "
"Well given what you guys have said	 and Alex's old comment (which I had forgotten)	 I'll review my evaluations and see if I can be more lenient on some points. Still	 it seems counterproductive to give them anything other than a zero. And Anonymous	 I don't mean to be a pretentious ass	 but any respectable institution of higher learning will tell you that plagiarism is the most serious academic offense	 serious enough to risk an expulsion. I think that should apply here as well	 in part because if we give good marks to plagiarists	 it just encourages more plagiarism in the future	 because it worked before. Conversely if we give good marks to people who might	 for example	 have problems expressing themselves in English	 then we're rewarding effort	 which I think is more important. But so be it. "
"Yes Pal. Weekly Quiz questions relate to the modules concerned in the OLI and the Video Lectures of Prof Smith. Please	 cover all Modules of OLI as per the Syllabus Schedule and hit the Quiz Tests.<br /> "
"So 52 upvotes are not enough to warrant a response?? Honestly	 it doesn't matter how many upvotes there are	 you're not going to help us	 are you?? <br /> "
62% why?<br /><br /> 
"I'm the one giving you a reality check.<br /><br />It seems clear to me that you are emotionally unstable	 posible bipolar. (it's okay	 we are in a psychology course	 and we can handle it)<br /><br />You made that other thread about ""drama Queens""	 and you are now the drama Queen	 thinking just because you paid a few bucks in Signature Track you are entitled to some royal treatment.<br /><br />When you say stuff like "" the so-called staff isn't professional enough "" I just had to laff	 this course is by far the best coursera course	 (and I've taken a few already)	 and profesor Smith is the best professor I've seen here.<br /><br />So if you think assigment 2 is faulty	 maybe it's your thinking patterns the ones that are faulty. "
"EMAIL6975 Beginner's Guide to Irrational Behavior course has already ended.&nbsp; It may run again	 but nothing has been confirmed.&nbsp; <span>Dan  Ariely is quite the unique personality and kept an upbeat tone throughout the course.&nbsp; There was a lot of surveys and studies going on within the class	 hence the jokes during the videos.&nbsp; This course provided at lot of information that is relatable to this class.&nbsp; Do be warned: there is a lot of reading of Economic Psychology studies.</span> "
"Hey guys	 my name is Stella and I'm from Malaysia. Psychology has always been a major interest of mine	 and I plan to major in Global Mental Health for my Masters. I love courses that are interesting	 stimulating and fun. 

Take care everyone and have a nice day! :) "
Thank you for your answer. I understand it is a matter of policy. 
"I am 64 too Christine. I do take notes	 but not when I am reading through	 first I read a page and work the interactive boxes then before going on to the next page	 I stop and make notes. It helps me to remember. I remember in college a few of my classes allowed a 3 x 5 card at times. We would make up the card with notes prior to class then we would go take our tests	 I do not think anyone used their cards during the test	 but it helped us to remember. Unfortunately I have something else going on that is causing additional memory problems right now. I am getting little deep sleep and less&nbsp; of a broken up light sleep than I can deal with. Its making things difficult	 including conversation. I start a sentence and cant finish it. If I weren't typing this It would not be happening. I am making some gains though. last test was one wrong thats a little closer to what I should be. Hoping this machine they put me on works. I want my old memory back. (sorry for the roaming lmao) <br /> "
"<p>I hope you&#39;re right. Maybe if we ignore it	 it&#39;ll go away.</p>

"It is possible to sign-off on a comment without leaving the ""Anonymous"" status.&nbsp; I have seen	 in other courses	 where students who wish to be anonymous will apply initials or a user identification name at the end of their post.&nbsp; This makes identifying which Anony is being addressed easier and reasonably clear.&nbsp; One doesn't have to use the same identifier every time	 but should be consistent within a specific thread.&nbsp; Just a thought. "
"I too don't see any new module or link added in Syllabus	 so thx Srividya	 I'm gonna use your link afterall. "
Thankfully the deadline has been extended by 24 hours &amp; the system now shows my previously submitted final exam &nbsp;having been accepted for grading. I knew the course staff is not inconsiderate! Thanks a tonne Dr. Alex sir. 
hi<br />thanks for the suggestion.. but i just want to know that how many modules are covered in one week?<br />&nbsp; 
"Hey I'm NAME3050868 from Pakistan. Currently doing MBA Finance and Chartered Accountancy from ICAP	 but I've always wanted to study Psychology.. and now i have the perfect way to do it thru coursera! Absolutely loving it! and learning loads!&nbsp; "
Thank you! :) 
"In addition	 this is what Alex said: ""<b><i>Since there is no quiz for Week 12	 the first 10 of these questions will cover Week 12</i></b>.""&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It explicitly states that there is <b>no quiz for week 12</b>.&nbsp; Also 	 week 12 material will be covered by the first 10 questions in the Final exam&nbsp; What's not to understand ? And where did Alex promise anything???<br /><br /> "
I guess the people doing the grading were anal retentive. 
"Yes	 I did	 except for that one question. I'm gonna do some research on it	 because it puzzles me.<br /> "
"Yes but we didn't get anywhere getting a text replacement for last week's error yet. Somewhere	 someone else is complaining about getting text files for Dr Smith's Psychology course! A transcriber got their titles switched.<br /> "
"If I'm remembering correctly	 there was some discussion about culture in intelligence modules	 but really... Culture? Maybe the word 'culture' in my native language is not the same as the word 'culture' in English? I seriously doubt it. <br /><br /> "
I hear you Fernando 
Thanks for this explanation!<br />The answers choice is so&nbsp;distracting. I thought that I didn't get the question correct because of them. 
"I am almost finished with Units 1 through 3 and my eyes are killing me.&nbsp; Using the ""open new window"" technique helps a little bit but the overall experience is not pleasant.&nbsp; Give me a paperback that I can underline text and make margin notes in any day over this text.&nbsp; The review questions in the learn by doing are just a fancy way to present ""review questions"" that could be included in the text.&nbsp; I will stick with it since I do want to learn the material but at this time I am not happy with the OLI at all.<br /> "
"Annete	 each score already have it's explanation. I suppose we'll be able to see marks for every criteria.&nbsp;<br />As people write at the forum	 they want to point how poor the work is	 how disappointed they are etc. I don't think they will be always right. "
"I have the same problem. Quiz 6
                is not activated for me!<br /> "
I would prefer for the REAL professor to sign in with his own name : ) 
"I was enrolled in that but had a chance to look at their expectations. I'm doing way too many courses as it is atm	 I can't devote that much time right now. Maybe we'll meet on some of the others. :-)&nbsp; <br /> "
Ok Philippos! Thank you for the clarification! Did you do well?<br /> 
"BTW I noticed your little dig at the end about my own paper being plagiarized. Sorry to burst your bubble princess but my paper is 97% original. You'll have to point that little knarly finger at someone else... maybe yourself. I don't understand why you are so upset about doing as you are told... oh maybe I know. You did a crappy paper that mentioned nothing about heritablity so now you want to punish people. Well	 as I mentioned	 you and a few others have been flagged and reported so I would proceed with caution	 if you like taking Cousera courses anyway. What a shame if you were banned from Cousera for something as stupid as not following directions and violating Cousera's Honor Code. Your call. "
"I don't think the problem is ""trolls""... it is different levels of engaged students. &nbsp;I understand that with the number of participants in the class	 it would be impossible for the professor to read each one. &nbsp;But it's not impossible to have psych students read each one	 and use that as a baseline to statistically evaluate the peer evaluations and throw out the ones that are consistently off base to the professional student and/or the other peers. &nbsp;This should be easy to do as it is just driven by analytics. "
"Thank you Hari!<br />This was really helpful indeed!<br />But due to the fact that there is a lot of confusion	 I propose that such analysis of the evaluation criteria should be given in advance to avoid misunderstandings and ofcourse wrong evaluation of assessments.<br />Thank you again!<br /> "
"It would be great to have the possibility to complete weeks	 and quizzes	 without having to stop	 and wait a full week to go on.&nbsp; "
Well said !<br /> 
"<p>No	 it wouldn&#39;t defeat the purpose. I understood the definition and application but a template would have been better in order to make my evaluator realize that I understood the points. That means	 it would improve the communication between peers. 
I have gone through peer review many times already and people often ignore aspects that are clearly stated. Being the assignment proposed for this course highly technical	 clear guidelines are necessary.
Peer review is a work in progress and in this process	 communication is a must.</p>
 "
"I want to reiterate the point I made earlier. When writing a research proposal	 explicitly stating the variables would be insulting the intelligence of one's audience. If the research is described fully	 the variables are obvious - explicit or not.<br />The ""other"" Anonymous! :)<br /> "
"Dear Marylin: it was there I found the info I posted above. Sorry	 just now I found your comments.<br /><br />Cheers. "
"My intention when I opened the thread was ""let's see if some random	 anonymous person who wears a hat	 and sometimes an umbrella takes any offence if I ask if people looks more white when they wear caps or hats.	 according to the monocular shadow rule"".<br /><br /><br />You totally got me. <br /><br /> "
"I agree with you and the OLI is much more then the videos	 I just think it's a lot for one week	 as they said it was a course that will take you 8 to 10h a week	 and study all that more the videos etc it's a lot more then 10h :( it's being difficult for me to take so much time for week	 was not expecting... "
"Another thought: If you are going to ask	 ""Are all steps	 stages	 or instructions necessary for conducting the experiment clearly defined?"" you should include what the steps and stages&nbsp;are.<br />Otherwise it's ambiguous and left up to the person doing the scoring.<br /><p><br /></p> "
"Good point NAME2645228. I havenÂ´t started yet with the readings for next week. In America there is a culture&nbsp;of prescription drugs&nbsp;for everything. If a kid if not the best in school s/he&nbsp;will be &nbsp;fed ritalin. If somebody is a bit sad	 s/he's prescrived prozac. Pills for everything and everybody so the drug industry makes the&nbsp;big bucks. My guess is that the real amount in America with any&nbsp;real psychological problems is far lower than 25 per cent of the population.DonÂ´r worry about your downvotes I love reading your comments and your "" mating dance"" with Nancy. "
"I agree; I think	 that recently some ""trolling"" group has joined Coursera courses and give 0 grading without reading the assessments	 just to ruin work of others :-) :-/ "
"If you guys are talking about some scorecard in OLI which I have not seen. I think your score there does not matter. OLI was just a prescribed book for this course. If the said score matters	 tell me how	 I would be&nbsp;very much&nbsp;interested in knowing that . "
"next time we'll get also comments from no experts	 as some people asked :)<br /><br /> "
"I have already describe an quasi-experiment. Now	 I have no enough time to rewrite it. But I think that a quasi-experiment is an experiment as good as a full experiment. This doesn't depend on your design	 depend on the question studied. Most of psychological question is related to social	 racial or educational groups exists and we are not able to choose a random sample of the population. <br /><br />I hope the choose of a quasi-experiment will not be negatively considered.<br /> "
"Hey	 I got my&nbsp;certificate&nbsp;just now. <br />Am so happy.<br />It feels great when your hard work pays.I missed the distinction by 2% but anyways :)<br /><br />Thanks again	 everyone involved and my class mates.<br />All the best.<br />NAME1670043 :)<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; "
"Where I come from	 if we&nbsp;are going to&nbsp;analyze the numbers	 we say	 ""We're going to crunch the numbers."" To us	 it's the same thing. I would hate to think that a lot of people are going to miss out on three points because the rubric seems to insist on using the phrase that the writer is familiar with. I honestly believe that was not the intention<br /><br /> "
"Yes	 I am so enjoying it myself. Each of them must have wrote or supervised each article corresponding to their expertise.&nbsp; "
EMAIL20062 should&nbsp; be a blue bar on the bottom right of the screen after selecting the grades from the dropdown boxes.&nbsp; Clicking that blue bar should submit the scores.

"In many cases it is up to the students that evaluates an assignment to give some marks or not due to his/her understanding of what it is written. For instance someone might not have mentioned the term ""hypothesis"" but in the assignment may be clear that there is one. Therefore If an assignment like:<br /><b>Hypothesis:</b> .........<br /><b>Independent varianble:</b>......<br /><b>Dependent variable:</b>.....<br />was that we had to do and nothing similar would be accepted	 then I am afraid that a lot of us have missed the target. And it is not our fault.<br />To be clear	 I mean that anyone who mentioned that uses a independent variable or is searching to prove something it is obvious that he/she defines an IV and has a hypothesis even he/she did n't write as in the example above.<br /><br /> "
"I read 6 works and <b>now one</b>&nbsp;mentioned cultural&nbsp;<span>cultural differences at all.<br />I also didn't. I wrote about&nbsp;experiment with white/black students	&nbsp; but then deleted because thought it is not important and only makes my work unreasonably big.<br />That will be really funny if everybody get 0 for that rubric!</span> "

"To me	 obviously we found out the ""hard way"" since day 1 with the pretest	 people here mean business and it is a strict course. So	 since you have the chance of preparing and testing yourself through the ""Did I get this right"" sections in OLI	 the ""final"" quizzes are quite serious and also strict. The reason why I asked about the policy	 besides wanting to go by the book so it's worth my effort	 is that exactly that: I've&nbsp;encountered&nbsp;people who thought they could (or maybe have?) consult OLI while taking the exams...So	 better ask	 even it is really a silly question.

"My opinion	 the peer assessments are not evil	 the intentions of some of the peers doing the assessment are.&nbsp; In another class I took	 some peers were giving bad marks based on their personal beliefs rather than following the rubric.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some people gave zeros when they believed the assignment was copies	 or when the believed there was too much citing and not enough original work.&nbsp; One individual stated that she gave zeros to someone who copied the information in their submission.&nbsp; Even provided the tools she used to check it...this tool is flawed.&nbsp; I used the same tool to test original work in&nbsp;creative writing	 no citations or quoting outside sources	 just a couple pages from a story I wrote.&nbsp; The software tool returned a score that said that it was not original work.&nbsp; As a fact it <b>was </b>original: I wrote it.&nbsp; "

"Hi	<br /><br />I believe you scored badly mainly because of the independent and dependent variables aspects. You did state your independent and&nbsp;dependent&nbsp;variables but I feel that they are stated wrongly.&nbsp;<br /><br />If I didn't misinterpret the meaning of&nbsp;independent&nbsp;and dependent variables	 an independent variable is something that you can control (meaning it's not affected by what we're going to do in the experiment thus it is independent	 you can change it freely) and a dependent variable is the result you get from your&nbsp;independent&nbsp;variable (it has to measure behaviour in our case because we're taking a psychology course).&nbsp;<br /><br />Therefore	 I feel that your independent variable should be the option to read notes or watch a video when you're studying and the dependent variable is how well the students learnt based on the option they were tasked with.<br /> "

"my score is 4 and this is the copy of my assignment :( please help&nbsp;<br /><br /><p><b>Intelligence: Nature vs. Nurture</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>If we say intelligence is nature it means that human beings are born with it but if we were to say it is nurtured then it means that one can be born not intelligent but develops the intelligence over time. According to Spearman	 intelligence is natural in that you either have the g-factor or not There is no part that he suggests improvement. He even goes ahead to say that those who passed continued to pass and those who failed	 continued to fail. In other words	 he was saying that you either have it or you simply do not have it. In classes as well as industries	 we have seen people improve in class and also people improve in the way they relate with others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Keeping the previous paragraph in mind	 it means that intelligence can also be nurtured as long as the individual is willing. The second theory was by Thurstone and according to him; there were many factors that constituted intelligence. In his tests he concluded that children tended to be either born intelligent or not as he failed to see the primary features he had in his theory. This was a shift in thought that one can be born as intelligent or not but as a child grows	 they begin to learn and nurture intelligence so according to him	 he does acknowledge that one is either born with it or not but as the person grows	 he or she	 will develop some primary features which will now determine whether the person is intelligent or not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a big controversy between whether inherited genes or the environment influences and effects our personality	 development	 behavior	 intelligence and ability. Some people believe that it is strictly genes that effect our ways of life	 others believe that it is the environment that effects us	 and some believe that both of these influence us. Either way	 social scientists have been struggling for centuries deciding whether our personalities are born or made. Tests are done often on identical twins that were separated to see how they are influenced. In the past twenty years	 it has been discovered that there is a genetic component to about every human trait and behavior. However	 genetic influence on traits and behavior is partial because genetics account on average for half of the variation of most traits. Urie Bronfrenbrenner	 who studies genetics	 said	 ""It is not nature vs. nurture	 but the interaction of nature and nurture that drives development."" Researchers are finding that the balance between genetic and environmental influences for certain traits change as people get older. Also	 people may react to us in a certain way because of a genetically influenced personality and	 we may choose certain experiences because they fit best with our instinctive preferences. This means that our experiences may be influenced by our genetic tendencies. One way researchers study the development of traits and behaviors is by measuring the influence of genetics throughout oneâ€™s life span	 and it is found to be that the genetic influence on certain trait increase as people age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>According to Howard Garner theory he does acknowledge that everyone is intelligent in their own way as there are different kinds of intelligence. It is then nurtures using appropriate tools that match the type of intelligence the individual exhibits. For example	 if a person shows interpersonal intelligence then the best tool to teach such a person is the use of group activities. Always ensuring that such a person is at a place where he or she can interact is important because the kind of intelligence harbored in such a person dictates the use of people as his or her best friend is people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>According to Sternberg in the Theory of Successful Intelligence	 he does agree that a part of the intelligence in a human being is general	 meaning natural or inborn. Quite a big chunk is developed by the person and this is dependent on the success levels the individual would want to reach. Intelligence is measured by the success a person has achieved in life but then success in the same individual's eyes. This means that everybody has different levels of intelligence as what one individual would term as intelligent	 another would not. According to Armstrong	 this means that intelligence is natural but it depends on how everyone uses it or nurtures it so as to be intelligent sully in terms of analyzing	 creating and practicalities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Depending on what base you are talking about intelligence	 it may fall under natural or being inborn but if we are to look at it from a success point of view then we can easily say it is nurtured. Therefore	 whether intelligence is nature or nurture is a matter of the point of view as well as the individual.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>NAME2940165 Spearman was a British psychologist who lived from 1863 to 1945. He introduced the general intelligence concept or the g factor to the psychology body of knowledge. He made use of a technique referred to as factor analysis to examine some mental aptitude tests. His results showed him that the scores he got on the mental aptitude tests were surprisingly so similar. If a person performs well in one cognitive test	 he or she also performs well on other tests administered and this was the trend. Those who had bad scores in the cognitive tests also had bad scores on the other tests that were administered. His conclusion after numerous tests and research was that intelligence is general cognitive ability that could be measured and numerically expressed.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>&nbsp;â€œIntelligence	 considered as a mental trait	 is the capacity to make impulses focal at their early	 unfinished stage of formation. Intelligence is therefore the capacity for abstraction which is an inhibitory processâ€. The psychologist Louis L. Thurstone came up with a different theory on intelligence whose main focus was the primary mental abilities. This challenged Spearman's theory then existing theory whose main focus was the g factor. He did not take intelligence to be a single entity whose ability is general but rather decided to focus on seven different â€œprimary mental abilitiesâ€.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>Thurstone's argument regarding the theory by Spearman was that the g-factor was a mathematical result of the procedures of a mathematical nature used to study it. His tests show that people with different IQ scores had different profiles when it came to the primary abilities. His tests however revealed the g factor when he administered the same tests to a group of heterogeneous children. He finally reorganized his theory to include the g factor as well as the seven primary abilities. This was a very important base for future psychologists who came up with theories.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>Gardner	 asserted that human intelligence needs to entail a comprehensive set of skill both learnt and acquired that aid him in solving a myriad of problems. Knowledge in indeed the food of the mind that keeps the mind motivated and challenged. Therefore	 human intelligence directly depends on what the human mind is exposed to in terms of knowledge. This theory was developed so as to give a more detailed description of competence intellectually than the theories herein mentioned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This theory was developed by Robert Sternberg who proposed that three fundamental aspects of intelligence exist; Creative	 Practical and Analytic. He maintained that Creative intelligence is absolutely necessary for the tackling of nearly strange tasks or when a human being needs to automate a task. Practical intelligence has been seen to be needed when a human being is to adapt to an environment in the best possible way while analytic intelligence referred to the processes that go in the mind so as to express intelligence. According to Sternberg	 general intelligence has been branded as being a family of the renowned analytic intelligence and it is the combination of the three fundamental aspects that one can have full insight into intelligence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The individual is termed intelligent if he or she has attained his or her success in life by the same person's standards. The success a person achieves in life can be attained by making use of the creative	 analytic and practical intelligence. These three in combination are given the name processing skills. Stein and Book argues that success is achieved by adapting to the environment in which one exists then shaping of the same environment as well as selecting the kind of environment the individual would want. This is done by making use of one's strengths and putting in effort so as to correct one's weaknesses. This theory is still a contentious issue among psychological scholars and hence we do expect other theories to come up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The definition of intelligence has not been well established and is still the reason psychologists are still fighting among other issues. It is therefore difficult to conclude as to whether intelligence is inborn or nurtured once a human being gets to earth. One thing is clear though	 every person has their own kind of intelligence which is worth exploring. This is inborn. After a person has realized their natural intelligence	 then they can nurture it.</p> "
"Deepali	<br /><br />I am sorry about your predicament. Why don't you change the title of the thread so that the attention of Course staff may be drawn fast?<br />Example: ""Mr Alex	 please reply since deadline is very near""<br /><br />In another&nbsp; thread	 a student has pointed out that only 2 assignments were served for evaluation. So	 the mechanism is still unclear.<br /> "
"How do you know	 that someone gave you 0 points in every question? I can only see my average marks and I don't even know	 how many people graded my experiment?<br /> "
"So you're doing what YOU want and not what the PROFESSOR asked?? How presumptuous of you to think you know better then the Professor!! Oh well	 I truly believe in karma and I look forward to seeing your whiny comments about failing! What goes around comes around! One bonus though	 now everyone knows what an ass you are!!&nbsp; :-)<br /> "
"The ""nature versus nurture"" controversy should be defined and discussed.&nbsp; (I would&nbsp;mark as 4 since you did say in several places that neither genetics nor environment can answer all the influences.)<br /><br />There should be a discussion of ""heritability""	 the proportion of  variability (or the extent to which the construct is) accounted for by  genetics.&nbsp; (Although there is not a lot of genetic discussion	 I believe that there is a discussion extensive enough to warrant a 3.)<br /><br />There should be a discussion of how twin and family comparisons can be used to determine heritability.&nbsp; (I read no discussion regarding the twin or family studies.&nbsp; I would have to mark as 0.)<br /><br />There should be a discussion of how knowledge of genes can be used to determine heritability.&nbsp; (You did mention how genetics was used by some researchers to determine heritability.&nbsp; 2	 which is full marks)<br /><br />There should be a discussion of how cultural differences can be used to determine heritability.&nbsp; (I saw nothing that discussed culture in determining heritability	 0)<br /><br />That would be a total of 9 if I had scored this paper.&nbsp; I read the assignments through	 then reread them as I assessed the submission against the rubric.&nbsp; <br /> "
"Linh	<br /><br />Do you have a strict Grand father at home?&nbsp; :-))<br /> "
"Hi	 Annette!<br />Exactly because there are no differences in epidemiology of scizophrenia across cultures we make the conclusion that culture does not apply to schizophrenia and we can claim that the risk of developing scizophrenia is determined by genes.<br /><br />The rubric criteria is read ""There should be a discussion of <b>how cultural differences can be used</b> to determine heritability"" which sounds to me like a specific method. I agree that it is too narrow for this kind of assignment!<br /> "
"Again	 I repeat	 it is not your call!! You were given clear instructions. If you don't follow them	 you are no better then those that ""plagiarized"". And how do you know they plagiarized?? Do you have an eidetic memory and remember everything on the internet?? Did you ever think that maybe what YOU think is plagiarism was really the fact that so much has been written about the these subjects that it is impossible NOT to write something that hasn't been written before? Did you think that maybe YOU remembered wrong and just THINK it's plagiarized because it sounds familiar? Who do you think you are?? If you think you know better then the professor	 what the heck are you doing here? God	 I hate people like you. You give them a bit of knowledge and they act like they know it all!! FOLLOW COURSE DIRECTIONS or leave!! (You can join the others that have been reported for not following directions) !!<br /><br /><br /> "

I don't remember who came up with a metaphor that ""life is a preparation of a candle out of the wax"". Some people got better wax at birth (e.g.	 they were born in USA to educated parents) and some people got worse (e.g.	 imagine being a woman in Afganistan).

im interested in social psychology. human beings&nbsp;behavior&nbsp;is sometimes very&nbsp;intriguing&nbsp; so i want to understand our&nbsp;behavior or attitude vis-a-vis certain situations.Also my master research is on learning and motivation and i want to know more about that.I hope taking this course will be of help for me 
This is a pulp fiction novela. A bunch of loser complaining insted of enjoying the course. 
This reminds me of Milgram's experiment :-) <br />Another anonymous<br /> 
I mean every chapter has 1-2 questions covering it? Do you think that I must also redo the lecture videos? 
"Nope	 sorry not me OP. But I am enjoying the show!&nbsp; :-)<br /> "
Thank you !<br /><br /> 
"Anon	<br /><br />Your study will not go waste. Chapters in OLI have been regrouped in alignment with the announcement for Week-11.<br />This appears to be a special provision in the OLI text for our course. If you access the OLI text directly and outside of Coursera	 you will find only the old module numbers.<br /><br />Anyhow	 I too wish that Mr Alex amended the Main Syllabus page.<br /> "
"Phoebe	 I feel so naive! You mean that's not the real professor Anderson? "
"Yes	 Svetlana. Attainment of union with the ""Absolute"" starts from the first step of 'absence of unhappiness'. Happiness	 Wisdom	 Enlightenment	 etc. are intermediary stages encountered in solitude. Of course	 this philosophy will not concur with the study of psychology as a science. We may get an opportunity in some philosophy course of Coursera to discuss such topics in detail for our own enlightenment :-)<br /> "
"In my evaluations I didn't take the criteria of ""say data will be analyzed"" literally. I have assessed for full marks even if the interpretation was there but without expressly mentioning it.<br /> "
"You are right actually. Thank you	 that makes the grade 69.7. Nevertheless	 I would like to complain about the final exam extensions. I completed the exam on time for the first deadline and after that the deadline was extended. I had no time to actually complete week 12 (it was at the same time as my University exams) and that was the reason for such a low grade. If I haden't completed the final exam	 I would have finished week 12 and probably scored higher and gotten my certificate. I feel it is unfair that there actually was an extension and that we were told about it after the first deadline was completed.<br /> "
"It does feel a bit like this course has been abandoned by the staff.&nbsp; <br /><br />For those who paid to for the Signature Track	 you can contact Coursera and request a refund.&nbsp; After the first two weeks Coursera does not refund money	 but the article I read said that they can issue a voucher to be used on another class.&nbsp; This class is informative; however	 if the second assignment goes the way the first did	 it may be worth the money spent. "
"That would seem like the logical solution	 but in this class	 we apparently aren't dealing with anything relating to logic. The motto of this course should be	 ""No brains allowed!"" "
"<p>&quot;What grade should I give someone who MENTIONS the words independent/dependent variable but does not DEFINE them?&quot;<br />I think it&#39;s a zero. (May be 2 for dependent variable.) Defining a variable is a basis to calling it right name.  </p>
<p>&quot;if someone doesn&#39;t SAY &quot;the data will be analyzed&quot; but SHOWS that it will be	 I guess they did not SAY so the answer is no&quot;
In this matter I&#39;m on Kathy&#39;s side. My opinion is that in evaluating of qualitative assignments actual meaning shoud prevale over formality.</p>

Thanks Professor for the clarification. <br /> 
"Hello.&nbsp;My name is NAME3126431. I am Brazilian and graduated in law. I have been interested in psychology and for this I am here	 doing the course. I wish everyone good studies. "
You are absolutely right! In this assignment we are not doing anything original. We are looking up existing research on the subject and using that information to write the assignment. If we reference the source then it is not plagiarism. Thanks for your comments.<br />

"You are welcome	 Isabela. This is how Psychotherapies work.<br /> "
"Have you ever heard of ""letting sleeping dogs lie""? Or ""Don't bite the hand that feeds you""? Or ""Don't look a gift horse in the mouth""? Do you have an original thought in your head or is everything a ""quote"" for you. I think I graded your paper in another course (Social Context of Mental Health). The whole paper was plagiarized with quotes from other people. Not one original thought! Is that why you're so angry? Was it you that got a big fat zero for copying and pasting other peoples work? If that's the case	 I can understand why you might hate peer assessments. You can fix that by using your own words next time. Whether it was you or not is irrelevant. Quoting OTHER PEOPLES work doesn't make YOU smart. <br /><br />-- NOT the original poster<br /> "
"I agree. The exam extension was unfair to a lot of people who struggled last minute to meet the deadline . .yet beneficial to those who could not. Meaning&nbsp; . . many who missed the exam by the original deadline were given a free pass . . .while many hard-working people who submitted by the deadline regardless of the outcome . . .(no pass) were cheated	 This is grossly <b><i>UNFAIR</i></b> !!. It will remain a stain on Coursera and this class. People like Nerea at least deserve some benefit. I hope Alex and Dr. Smith and Coursera have the heart to do what's right. <br />Also	 when rules change downstream or changes are made pn the fly	 <b><i>EVERYONE should be duly&nbsp; notified with enough advance notice.</i></b><br /> "
Exactly!

Great! Best wishes. 
"You just don't stop	 do you? What are you trying to do	 see how many days it takes the whole course to hate you? I'm guessing a few more days should do it.<br /><br /> "
"So now you think I am here for your entertainment? Hahahahahahahahahahahaha Yeah	 let's see if that works better then you telling the doctor what to do. Hahahahahahaa&nbsp; omg you are hilarious.

"Wow	 that is great :D what have you seen here? "
thanks U 
"Just for the record	 I did not downgrade anyone's comments. Also - I am scoring papers with generosity. If there is anything in the discussion that I can label cultural (in the widest definition possible)	 I give the points. I was only pointing out that <i>if you were to go by the OLI</i>	 then Phoebe is correct. So	 anon	 do not expect bad grades from me - I'm with you in this! "
Thanks a lot Hari. This is too good. Read all the comments in that thread. Thanks again. 
Yes yes there is! I am at a total loss.... 
DITTO! 
"I've read through dozens... so no. I'll see if I can them it again tomorrow. But one of them said that ""One person even gave me all zeros"" &nbsp;... rather than ""I got all zeros"".<br /> "
"Not a mater of ""smartness""	 but more of observation when you have a clear head. Otherwise you can be observant and still get carried away and not see what is in front of you. So	 I was just ""lucky"" (though the professor was really the professor) and concentrated. that's all "
"Anonymous - given that nothing in the assignment instructions related to the evaluation rubric	 in my opinion this is a very harsh	 if not untenable	 position to take.<br /> "
"Pa nije problem cujemo se na mail ti postavi mail i to je to...svakako mi engleski nije bas najbolji hocu reci nikada nisam ucila na engleskom nesto	 a toliko sam radosna zbog ovog kursa :))) "
"Hi Kathy. Thanks for taking me up on that. With my own peer assn marks of 17.5/23 and 13.5 /15	 they average to (17.5+13.5)/(23+15) which equals 31/38 = 0.816. Multiply by 40% gives 32.63%. <br /><br />Now individually giving each assn 20 %:- &nbsp; (17.5/23) x20% = 15.22%.&nbsp; Next (13.5/15) x 20% = 18%.&nbsp; Total:&nbsp; 15.22% + 18 %&nbsp; = 33.22%.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />I'm not sure how it worked for you. This is how it worked for me. And I suppose I could generalize from this. Which do you think is preferable. . . 32.63%. . or. . 33.22% . . . ??&nbsp;&nbsp; And isn't this the way Alex said it will be done ?? <br /> "
EMAIL27764 think I would need to throw two balls at once in order to cover all the position options. 
"Veronica	<br /><br />To my understanding	 the following items will suffice to qualify for the design.<br />1. Identify a problem and write an observation (rationale for choosing the problem)<br />2. Frame the NAME487897ehavior Question<br />3. Re-state the Question as a Hypothesis<br />4. Identify the Control Group	 Experimental Group	 All types of Variables	 etc. and write their Operational Definitions<br />5. Describe the experiment including the manipulation of the Independent Variable<br />6. Explain how behavior is quantified and result studied using the Variables<br />7. State how you expect the result of the experiment to either prove or disprove your hypothesis<br /><br />You may falter once or twice. NAME487897ut	 soon you will catch an experimentable problem and finish the assignment.<br /><br />NAME487897est wishes :-))<br /> "
"The ones I'm talking about didn't even bother slightly paraphrasing the information	 which would at least slightly assuage the gravity of the plagiarism. At least those who had some trouble with English evidenced a degree of analysis beyond just copy and pasting. "
"I agree	 Anony	 I rewrote my assignment to include what Alex suggested and none of it even mattered. "
"Still	 the Professor of the Course believes that the class he teaches should be taught in a particular way. if he thinks a peer assessment is needed	 our opinion is just our opinion. 

There are several kinds of disability. If this is so important for you	 why do you focus on peer assessments? What about videos without subtitles or sign language	 aren't they illegal for you? If you are serious about it	 maybe you should try covering more serious conditions (more referring to number	 not severity).

i would take your opinion more seriously if you hadn't slammed ILLEGAL all over. People with certain disadvantages should have exeptions and actions should be taken to eliminate hardship as much as possible. But it should be an organized effort	 and not just ""cut the peer assessment	 people"". That doesn't solve anything.


 "
"Phoebe	 the work of a lot of people went into that book! I guess that's why it's so good. "
don't think so Amy. 
Even depression can bring something positive :-)<br /> 
"Thanks for your comment Alicia	 and I hope that you find what you want out of this course. I can understand about feeling you are out of the loop. My college education was from the late 80's. Everything I have learned is probably obsolete by now. After being incapacitated for so many years	 with my own mental illness	 it can be very daunting to start again. I feel these courses will bring me back up to date	 and gives me the opportunity to ease back into dealing with other people (a part of my illness is that I'm afraid of contact the outside world	 there's so many bad people and not many good. I have to admit	 these forums have not exactly proved me wrong). ;-) I wish you great luck and success in completing this course! <br /> "
"You are very magnanimous	 Annette. I feel honoured ... :-))<br /> "
"Also Alex	 please reconsider on my Assignment 1	 I was given a 3 on the ""data would be analyzed"" section where in the assignment I clearly state:<br /><br /><b>Evaluating results:</b><br />Once we evaluate the 
conversations about the polemic issue of all of the participants	 we 
will collect the results and create a graph in order to see if there is a
 great difference in between the people who completed the mazes in 10 
minutes and the ones who did the same job in 40 minutes. We will look at
 the words they have used during the conversation about the polemic 
issue. <br />If the results show that people who are put into stress 
before a conversation of something polemic are more aggressive	 then	 
our hypothesis will be correct.<br /><br />1 point more on that section would mean my grade on assignment 1 would be: 18.PHONENUM<br /><br />And total grade would be: 70.6 (70.ZIPCODE08)<br /><br />Please take this into consideration because it means passing the course.<br /><br />It was a great course and I do recomend it to everyone.<br /><br />Thanks for the help.<br /> "
"Will your sign this address with your name? :D<br /><br />Yes	 maybe Prof. Smith has no time to communicate with us directly	 but I always considered the presence of the instructor at the forum as a bonus	 not an obligatory thing. Actually an online course can be run automatically	 self-maintaining	 so to speak :D.<br /><br />""This IS a fiasko for anyone who has worked hard for 10 weeks only to 
fail now because of the questionable managment of this last assignment.""<br />I understand your frustration but	 as the professor in another Coursera course told	 MOOCs are experiment and everyone is free not to be engage in it. This form of presenting the knowledge exists only for couple of years! We are pioneers	 guys!<br /> "
"EMAIL27764 are&nbsp;only three&nbsp;methods are listed on page 181.&nbsp; They are listed as being used for only one side of the equation.&nbsp; This website has a list of different research methods:&nbsp; <a href=""http://psychology.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_research_methods"">http://psychology.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_research_methods</a>&nbsp;but having so many to choose from could be confusing.&nbsp; "

"I kind of agree with everyone. I just read three papers and not one mentioned cultural differences. I mentioned socioeconomic factors	 but I don't know if that counts as cultural differences. Also	 I'm surprised that many of the criteria being evaluated is all or nothing. You either get 3 pts or you're down 3 pts. No in between. I'm doubting I'll pass this assigment.&nbsp; "
"I think that is a bit unfair. All the steps to designing an experiment had been taught. If you didn't feel that you got it	 it may be good to go back and read through the section again :)<br /> "
"Another	 maybe ""naked"" aspect that I hold on to	 is that personal moral let's you do whatever you want	 if your&nbsp;decision&nbsp;affects you and only you. Still	 in my eyes	 morality is about a person't personality and comes from a peson's personality and is INTERPRETING maybe his mentality and inner self!&nbsp; "

I need to get a little ahead so I can go back and review to keep this working for me or I will not remember anything when we get to the final.&nbsp; Good luck I think even though our brains are thinking 60s we will do like we were in our 40s!&nbsp;&nbsp; lol sleep ........I think I vaguely remember what that is (just kidding)! <br /></b> "
"This is an awesome course	 John. Professor Charmaine Williams is an amazing teacher and everything in the course is well put together and well explained and well functioning!&nbsp; Enjoy!<br /> "
"This is my first course and I was hoping for more interaction. I get that the OLI content is very important and contains lots of information	 like a mini library	 which couldn't have been in a video	 but I find it more vivid and attractive if more videos would be added in the future. As to give a breath	 make it more interesting and take some of the ""tiresome"" texts.&nbsp; "
"oops	 that makes sense (haven't thought about it). if it's not a trouble	 please post the correct answer	 once the quiz will be closed. "
"According to your profile you're ""super cute	"" 36	 and single and you're looking for interested women on Coursera to contact you.<br /><br />Consider this: maybe you haven't found a woman yet is because you have a disgusting sense of humor that	 in this case	 mocks women. "
To whom are you addressing your remark? 
"To be fair	 If I find 'environmental influence' mentioned	 I plan to give marks for 'cultural differences'.&nbsp; "
"Lidia	<br />Your POV is excellent. I too agree that no child would be introduced to Iced tea right after breast milk.<br /><br />I limited my view to the information explicitly given in the question. As for common sense and practicability your view is the correct one. Kudos to your tenacity :)<br /><br />Thanks.<br /> "
Thanks Hari.<br /> 
"EMAIL27764 kind of like this idea	 however	 if we are not better trained to interpret the assignment itself	 we are no better off.&nbsp; Some people will still score zero if the analyze quote is not present or if they cannot	 themselves understand the meaning of independent and dependent variables.&nbsp; "
"<span>Annette	 the difference between marks is clearly explained in marks description.&nbsp;</span>There's nothing to add - in my opinion. If you got ""3"" instead ""5""	 read what is demanded for ""5""	 ""3"" and extract what's missing.&nbsp;<br />Anyway	 you cannot complain	 even if you think that the evaluating person got you wrong.<br /><br />If you can see from early posts about ""poor experiments""	 people just want to say how disappointed they are with the work.&nbsp;I don't think that many students aren't educated enough to post their comments on that kind of work. "
"THE GRADES HAVE NOT BEEN RELEASED YET. &nbsp;DO NOT COUNT YOURSELF OUT YET	 AMY. &nbsp;YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT ADJUSTMENTS MAY HAVE BEEN MADE.<br /> "
"Yes	 you are allowed to ""save"" your quiz and review	 and then return to it. The quiz is not scored until you hit ""submit."" That's the whole purpose of having a ""save"" button. "

"My paper is 86% original work. My references are within the text	 and they were marked as 'existing'. If I have time	 I'll delete the references and recheck. <br /><br />I don't understand how can somebody be called a plagiator if he clearly states his references next to the paragraphs with his own sentences? <br />Or if somebody quotes a short paragraph	 puts it within quotation marks and clearly reference the source? Some of the texts on wikipedia have a huge list of references. I use those references	 I go to the original paper and read an abstract	 the whole paper if available	 the conclusion	 and state something like this:'They found that...' (reference: name of authors	 name of article	 name of the magazine	 year of publishing	 and a note that it was on the Internet).<br /> "
"Of course you are more than welcome to add your opinion	 this IS a public forum. However	 I'll let the Coursera staff decide that for themselves. You wouldn't happen to be the same anonymous that posted the thread I'm referring to	 now would you?? No worries	 this is a serious matter and Coursera will deal with it as they see fit... Have a nice day	 anonymous!! :-)<br /> "
"And you never thought about the fact	 that they didn't use computers? Coursera relys on human judgement	 because it is just not about looking for special words. You have to look for the meaning of ""data is analyzed"". It can be said with totally other words or written in an implicit way. But the fact is still there and humans can find it and judge correctly. (Ok	 obviously not all participants in this course can do it	 but at least the most...8-P)<br /> "
"I totally. This is my first time to do a course of this nature	 so as yet haven't tried a peer reviewed test	 but I remember a lot of other students	 people have different backgrounds and different experiences	 and so yes may have a different perspective on your work	 but I think that will enrich the quality of your learning rather than be negative. <br /> "
"Sorry but I barely slept	 worked all day	 and the quality of your post does't inspire me in making any effort in my writing. And I'm not devaluating myself I'm just trying to open your eyes on the fact that your problem with peer assesment is subjective. And yes you post is a RANT!!! Something like 'I'm worry about the peer assessment	 according to scientifc studies	 students are not as objectived as teacher	 what do you think?' would have been a nice and constructive way to introduce the problem. I could prove you I'm neither a liar	 nor a bad instructor and that my grammar can be totaly fine when needed (for a non-native english speaker) but I'm not here to brag about myself and undermine people.

"I like you answer here anonymous. It's nice and reasonable. If you could always express yourself like that	 rather than in an agressive and confrontational way	 it would give much more weight to the message you're trying to convey. Btw I was sure you were a philosopher. Doing my bit of psychoanalysis too hehe. "
"Not only is English my first language	 but I am a also a professional writer. I understood Assignment 2 as written	 <b>but it is vague and leaves itself open to a world of interpretations</b>. A person could write an excellent paper that follows the assignment (as understood by that person) and still be trumped by a grading rubric that has criteria that were not specifically mentioned. I stand with others (native English and English as a second or third language speakers) who feel the assignment needs some clarification "
"First off	 Anon	 why post this garbage if you are not trying to get feedback? You don't make sense. And just because you use big words	 doesn't mean you know HOW to use them. All I see from you is bile. You are rude	 you are obnoxious and you are obviously VERY sick because you are delusional about your own intelligence. You DID attack me by saying that I was faking being mentally ill and saying I was malingering. You aren't smart	 you are mean and arrogant. You think that by intimidating people with your version of the facts that makes you right. It just makes you a fool. I'm not going to stoop to your level anymore. I've reported you and I have written a letter directly to the Professor about your ""legal issues""&nbsp; and I'm sure they'll be dealing with your trouble-making soon enough. I don't need to waste more time on you!! BTW I'm wondering if you're smart enough to know that even though you are ""Anonymous"" Coursera AND the Professor knows exactly who you are! Have fun with the rest of the course. I'm not sure about you but I'll be doing fine with my peer assessments. Then again	 I know how to talk to other people!!<br /> "
"I figured one of you morons would be playing that card. No	 my issue is that I spent 2 weeks working my butt off	 writing an awesome paper. What I'm very nervous about is one of you idiots who thinks they know better	 will think it's plagiarized because you're not smart enough to realize that someone could actually write a great paper. But that's not the point. The reason you were reported	 Damien et al	 is because you won't follow the direction given by the course. It doesn't matter what YOU think. It only matters what the professor and staff think. What makes me sick is people like you who come to these courses and waltz around like you are some kind of expert!! <br /> "
"Katherina	 I'm not offended at all! :)<br />""if you did receive great score it doesnt mean that next time you will 
not meet with the person that without any reason gives you zeroes"" Very true!<br />And
 this is situation where you can do nothing. You don't even know who 
downgraded you and there is noone to appeal to. These MOOCs is a totally
 new phenomenon	 we have to learn how to deal with it to receive more 
benefit and less harm! And peer grading is the most controversial point.<br /> "
"I understand that there are different copyright rules in different countries. All I'm asking is that if you use a video in <b>connection with an exercise</b>	 you make sure everyone can access the video. It's not just a video to watch for my entertainment	 you ask questions in relation to the video. How am I to know whether a random video on YouTube has the same information you are asking for? For the first time since starting this course	 I find OLI lacking	 and with all due respect	 I find your response a bit dismissive. You ask us to give feedback when we encounter problems and then you tell me to Google it!!<br /> "
"Hi Eser!! I did study literature and linguistics in Spanish. Which language are you a professional on? I would like to keep in touch	 so if you'd like to	 you could add me on fb. NAME3124335 NAME3124335 Secher Valdes.&nbsp;<br />By the way	 there's a coursera prychology group on fb	 which has the name of the course :)<br />NAME3124335 "
Both appear to be exactly the same to me. Many of the questions felt different from what we studied.<br /> 
same 11 out of 20.so many false things we thing are correct. hope to future improvement. 
The .txt file!<br /> 
Likewise - that would be analysis.<br /> 
<span>All got one mark for this question.</span> 
"Nice job	 raising this question	 because for this assignment a lot of bibliography and Internet search was required	 therefore many of us might have an assessment that is in the limits but with references it might be outside.<br />So if anyone has the answer let him/her share it with us.<br />Thank you!!! "
"Thanks	 it worked. "
"Thanks	 Alex. That's good news. "
"Ok	 so what is the maximum score? Do we get to see what we forgot to mention? "
"I agree that language can be an extra difficulty	 but it is not a variable with which is counted. Also	 depression	 work stress	&nbsp; disease	 divorce	 death of a family member etc	etc. could form extra difficulties for the student in particular (and also proofable: medical record	 divorce papers etc). <br />If the language difficultiy would be accepted as an argument to have another test than what should be the treshold? Nearly any english knowlegde: you can repeat the exam 1000x; intermediate level (non-native): you can repeat 10 x etc. It is hard for the staff to allow such extra tests	 because it is hard to measure and verify(!) the different language levels of every particpant/student that will apply for a retest.<br /> "
"Well	 this is an interesting proposal to face the problem. Ok. I will wait for 2-3 days and if i have not taken a response until then 	 i will follow your proposal. Many thanks.<br /> "
"Jimmy	<br /><br />See my comment to the preceding post by Margarita. You may find the links useful.<br /> "
"How do you wait for a whole week? I don't get it. Don't you have to study for it? If you have like	 20-30 pages from OLI to read	 will you finish all that in 1 day?! "
"I shuttered	 while reading that at the civilized Germany one can decides a child's' fate between the age 8-12! How could they? At that age I was working collecting huge bags of roses' flowers :-) They were using petals for jams	 tea etc. etc. <br /><br />Why do you want to leave? I mean that not every country has a welfare program..	 I think that German welfare is better than American. <br /> "
"I've&nbsp;analyzed&nbsp;them by myself	 I'm a rebel! :-)) "
"Indeed	 that's the problem :-(<br />Amdrea<br /> "
Nobody is an expert is correct so I wouldnt speak like one. &nbsp;Someone with a grade in the 60s may get discouraged but often times points may be granted. &nbsp;You dont know so dont act like you are so sure. &nbsp; 
"Katherina! <br /><br />NUMBER ONE - These are public forums. If you don't want people to comment	 don't write anything. <br /><br />NUMBER TWO - You are rude and arrogant	 so you will probably not find any help here anyway. <br /><br />NUMBER THREE - Your posts show poor grammar and English	 which is probably one reason you got a poor grade. <br /><br />NUMBER FOUR - You probably didn't answer the question properly because if you were smart enough to do that	 you would know better then to insult your peers. <br /><br />I wish I had judged your paper	 you would have gotten a ""0""... just because!&nbsp; :-)<br /> "
"I am emboldened to give my opinion.<br /><br />If the same Sample Group is instructed to act under two different conditions at two different times by varying the Independent Variable	 it will complete the design.<br />:-)<br /> "
"""You compare the course with the one run at the university..."" You misrepresent me. I said no such thing. ""Still the rubric is bad."" Yes	 it is. That's why I adressed it in my comment	 but you seemed so happy contradicting me	 I let it go. :-) "
"&gt;I find amazing that USA give us the opportunity to learn and take a profit remaining in our countries.<br />I like that you stay positive and manage to use the last grain that you have to flourish. It's a nice proverb about people like you :-)<br /><br />I have taken ""Sastainability"" course too about half a year ago. Great lecturer	 ah? <br />I'm still working on the project that I have proposed on that course. My project is about helping african refugees. I get nothing in terms of money	 but at least its very fulfeeling and I meet interesting people. Some guys/gals have a talent of making money from nothing	 but I am not one of them :-(<br /><br />I wish you success in your project. I believe that healing people is very improtant. Happy and healthy people make others happy. Less crime. More gratitude. But how can you do it on the global level?<br /><br />Amrea<br /><br /> "
Thanks a lot. I ll do just that. 
"Nancy	 although you do not care anymore	 I will still answer for those that are not yet ""road weary.""&nbsp;&nbsp; I did go back and read the question: ""Compared to the participants in Sherifâ€™s study	 those in Aschâ€™s study exhibited more...""&nbsp;&nbsp; This question is looking for what Asch's study shows more of when compared to Sherif's study. "
"I saw the videos a few months ago	 and was surprised	 in&nbsp;a negative way. This&nbsp; guy is a narcissist...totally obsessed with himself. Notice how he feels he must make a ""joke"" every minute	 and a reference to Yale every minute	 and talks in a tone like ""I am a god	 but it's okay	 you are lucky I am gonna teach you something"". He created zero emotional conection with the students	 he had to beg them to ask him anything during the pause for questions. "
"For a guy who's 55 years old	 you sure stay up late... You're retired	 probably? Lucky you! I wanna learn everything interesting in Coursera but I have school and all that so yeah	 priorities...<br /> "
hello my name is megha i always interested to study psychology so i got the opportunity to join this course and im looking forward to this course.. &nbsp; <br /> 
"Hello: I just joined the course a week late.. I am NAME2258443 from NY I am almost retired	 have deep learning desire	 keen interest in psychology.. so decided to take this course. "
"Wow!!! Thank you	 OP. You make me feel really good about myself	 because beside you	 I seem normal. "
"Which courses where those	 Jennifer? I love OLI material. "
"Yes Anonymous	 this IS my question and thank you for correcting my wording. Obviously to be able to take the quiz	 one must have studied it first.&nbsp; "
"That wasn't a ""royal we"" Javier	 it was all of us minus you! "

"Saray	

Tuvieron un problema con los videos y los subtitulos	 pero tengo entendido (y ya probe) que estan funcionando bien. 

Parte de la idea de este hilo en el foro	 es poder ayudarnos mutuamente con los temas del idioma	 asÃ­ que cualquier consulta de algo que no entiendas o complicaciones con el inglÃ©s	 con confianza. "
"I'm so depressed now	 specially when I could have gotten better grades for my 2 assessments. I wonder whether the people managing this course sometimes look by themselves at the assessments made by the peers?<br /> Good course. Too bad that I failed for 2 points. I wish a lot of success to future students. "
"Hello all	 i'm Rohit from India. I have a keen interest in understanding the mind	 the self and the nature of reality. I'm also doing the 'know thyself' course. The content of this course is very interesting and i hope i can cope up with it. "
"As per announcement	 it will take about 3 more hours for the 3rd week videos to be uploaded. it is premature now to keep trying. Check the <b>Lecture Videos page</b> after 3 hours	 <b>not</b> the Week-3 page.<br /> "
thx T.T &nbsp; 
"Teach me	 master. "
"Hi Diana	 check the Syllabus page. It will be clear to you. Modules 1 to 4 for week-1; 5 to 8 for week-2; etc.<br /> "
Thanks Hari. Had same problem and spent a lot of time trying to make out the result as I thought I understood the law well. Anyway the OLI and Prof. Smith's video lectures are too good for words. 
"I always read throughout the paper and try to grade flexibly	 so if you don't use the word ""culture""	 as long as I still understand that you're talking about culture	 I will give you points	 so don't worry about this.<br /><br />Alex's instruction actually guided people a lot. Without his instruction	 I think the scores would be <i>incredibly </i>low. Now	 for the papers I evaluated	 nobody has scored under average (&lt;7 points). But still I'm pretty disappointed that the rubric left no room for deep thinking from students themselves. "
"Thank you Leah	 a complex meaning if you ask me... "
Thanks for your attention. 
I agree .

Do we agree we have instincts? I suppose so but the real question is how much is instinct and how much isn't. On a scale from 0 to 9 I would put it somewhere around 2 but that's just an opinion. Not even the PH.D's have an answer for that one.

"I agree that people in signature track are you more in depth but I just feel The Class should be enjoying and fun and going over and over about this is just is good and worthwhile but should end. Plagiarism is wrong but I know I make mistakes and don't quote everything but I know rewording is very important. Sorry just saying that people need to be told they do wrong and learn from their mistakes. Also maybe when growing up they didn't have people to tell them and help them. so all I'm saying is that we should do what we are required in this class and make notes for the papers so people can all learn. I didn't plagiarize the first paper but did very low cause I did a lesson instead of a experiment which I thought I did but what I am saying is we all make mistakes and especially with people all	over the world trying to do this we should all just learn and whatever we are told by our classmates appreciate it and learn.

EMAIL12016 Why is it unlawful to comment on a paper.&nbsp; In the US opinions are protected by the Freedom of Speech.&nbsp; We do not need to be an expert in anything to form or vocalize an opinion.&nbsp; I believe the idea of having a comment section is so that the peer grading the material can explain their thoughts while completing the grading.

"Absolutely	 Jenn	 and I have also seen very few posts on Coursera forums that I would consider inappropriate or inflammatory. Generally	 the student cohorts are very supportive and positive in the forums. I guess there always exceptions	 however. I generally try to ensure that my posts cannot be misconstrued etc.	 so as not to inflame or insult in any way. Forums are a great breeding ground for misunderstandings and over-reactions	 devoid as they are of any sense of the writer's tone.<br /> "
Signature Track members have a legitimate reason to be asking for their money back. There's NO support in this course. It's a joke! Look at how many requests for help there are in the forum that haven't even been acknowledged! <br /> 
I agree.<br /> 
"I cannot find my grade and certificate either!! please Alex	 tell us where we can find this data! "
"Now that does sound like a great idea after all. No anonymous posters!!! :-)
 "
ps it was the anonymous post an hour ago (i had just found my score and was a bit perplexed) 
"I wish you the best of luck with this courses and the other you took Federica! That's why I love the concept of Coursera. I was lucky enough to be able to do all the studies I wanted and I wish everyone could too. I agree that peer assessment are scary	 and there may be bias	 and may be really disappointing and frustrating if you feel like someone did not review your work properly but this a way to keep the course free and accessible to everyone then this is a way to go! In addition	 despite what a scientific study apparently said	 I personally found marking other people essays really useful. When you read other people work you can then work out things that makes the argument clearer or instead confusing and then you can apply it to your own work :). "
"Hmmm	 after reading again the rubric	 I have reconsidered my earlier problem... although I still believe that it is a far stretch to consider intelligence as 'a behaviour'	 since it includes many more things	 I think that the rubric means a different thing and simply asks if behaviour is measured and of course what is done in the experiment is that behaviour is measured and later generalised to get ""intelligence""...<br />Speaking about the validity: in my case the experimenter wants to test intelligence by the speed (not number of failures or something like this) at which a rat solves a maze... I consider that speed is a highly confoundable measurement	 as it depends on such things as physical fitness	 the appetite of the rat	 if it's willing to run or not	 etc. that means	 many things that have nothing to do with intelligence...<br />Talking about the general problem of the rubric... it was not what I had expected	 but nevertheless it works	 don't you think? I've evaluated 6 experiments and have had one clear all-zero	 one clear all-five and some things in between	 so I consider it does work just fine...<br /> "
Thanks. :) 
"Svetlana	<br />What made me think it was not defined? I read the submission as I was scoring it. Several times as a matter of fact (as I did for any submission I was hesitant about) - which is more than my scorers did! "
"It's a Behavioural Economics course and it is by far one of the best produced courses I have taken out of the 14 or so I have taken so far.<br /><br />Great lectures. Very involved professor and TAs. Interesting (bonus) guest lecturers every week. Fascinating topic. I highly recommend it. Workload can sometimes be a bit much if you do not plan your time well (quite a bit of reading required but if you can manage this class's OLE material	 then you will do ok in the other course). Passing grade is quite high (85%) but if you watch all the lectures and read the required material attentively	 passing is easy.<br /> "
Thats reminiscent of extra-verbal communication! Remember the lack of facial expressions etc in posted communication decreases its effectiveness. Using emoticons helps &amp; could have avoided the confusion. 
"I hope everything goes good for you. Even if you didn't use the WORD

I have to admit I'm pretty disgusted with the fact that so much of our
grade relies on a word!!&nbsp;

"Just to correct your above comment about ""expecting empathy without having demonstrated any"". I think we have the answer to whether you are capable of empathy. There is something you have misunderstood about empathy. Empathy is something you either have or don't have. It's not something you can turn on and off depending on who you consider worthy. It doesn't work that way. It's an involuntary reaction. I don't know what you're talking about up there but it isn't empathy.
 "
"""The hypothetical construct is the object of the study	 and behavior is being measured"".<br />""Intelligence"" is a hypothetical construct (yes	 it is	 no one has seen it yet :D).<br />""Behaviour being measured"" is doing intellegence test or puzzle	 or smth.<br />Manipulating intelligence without lobotomy? How about education? :D<br />UPD: Or television? XD<br /> "
"Hi Anon	 thanks. Yes	 1 point will make a BIG difference to a lot of people. I feel better knowing it's not just me.<br /> "
"I am frustrated by the marking rubric requiring <b>explicit</b> 
statement of the variables. One would not usually explicitly state your 
variables in a research project - stating the purpose of the experiment	
 the hypothesis and the method would normally implicitly state the 
variables without offending your readers' intelligence by explicitly 
stating them. <br /><br />While I agree that a template is inappropriate	 we should have been given clarity regarding the expectations prior to submission. Most university assignments provide the marking rubric with the assignment so that students know what they are expected to submit. As you say	 this is especially important given the wide diversity of the student cohort conducting these peer assessments in Coursera.<br /><br />Notwithstanding that I fundamentally disagree with the peer assessment methodology - having had abysmal experiences of it while participating in other courses.<br /> "
"You may address the problem to the TA through a suitable thread under ""Technical Issues"". There is no provision to address the TA directly by email	 etc.<br /> "

Hover the mouse pointer at your name on top of the page. Options roll down. Click ""Course records"" and you reach the certificate.<br /> "

"Yes. The correct approach in assessment is to see how much the student has learned and tried to conform to an experimental design rather than how far she is deviating from formatted procedure. For many students	 this is the first time that they are coming across a concept like research method.<br /> "
"Thank you Helico. I don't know what the official guidebooks say	 but I know yelling when I hear (or see it). I feel sorry for the person who received the brunt of it. Not only yelling	 but twisting a person's comment to mean something that was actually never said.<br />~ Hurt bystander "
"Still	 the Professor of the Course believes that the class he teaches should be taught in a particular way. if he thinks a peer assessment is needed	 our opinion is just our opinion. 

There are several kinds of disability. If this is so important for you	 why do you focus on peer assessments? What about videos without subtitles or sign language	 aren't they illegal for you? If you are serious about it	 maybe you should try covering more serious conditions (more referring to number	 not severity).

i would take your opinion more seriously if you hadn't slammed ILLEGAL all over. People with certain disadvantages should have exeptions and actions should be taken to eliminate hardship as much as possible. But it should be an organized effort	 and not just ""cut the peer assessment	 people"". That doesn't solve anything.

The only two ways to have known thw maximum scores was to either score the maximum or to total up the rubric points. I do not think it was as such announced anywhere separately. I totalled up the rubic scores. 
"oh.

"I wonder if anyone has done a study on whether relationships change for the better after people take the MBTI. Two examples that have at least been considered:<br />1) Inmates - one study showed that a certain type (I don't remember what it was) was disproportionately large in the prison population. They also had a high high school drop out level	 and a style of learning that is not accomodated by public schools. Theory: if you find that type early in life (say in their teen years) and teach them with the style that they learn best from	 would they be more likely to graduate and become productive members of society?<br />2) I don't know if it is true today	 but it used to be that the number one reason for Christian missionaries leaving the field and returning home early was their inability to get along with other missionaries (mostly attributed to personality clashes). Theory: if you use the MBTI to train missionaries in how to appreciate differences and learn to work together	 would it then prevent early return	 thereby lowering the cost for the sponsoring organization?<br /><br />It seems to me that if you can show a positive cost-benefit	 it would go a long way to building legitimacy for the MBTI.

"Personally	 I don't think it would make a difference. These courses are supposed to be closed and yet the trolls have managed to sneak in anyway.

"Peer assessments are too big to be handled by the limited number of TA's. All submitted evaluations can be re-submitted any number of times until the deadline.

"Well	 thats not exactly correct in my point of view.

THAT is the first rude and degrading comment of the thread and it is written by the YOU. This is what set the barre for all those comments that followed. Just wanted to clear that up. Now if you have problems telling reality from fantasy	 you can't expect US to help you. Maybe you don't have enough money to seek help and you think you can get it here	 but unfortunately no one here is qualified to or wants to give you the medical attention you so desperately need. I'm really sorry for you	 because you obviously believe that you are the victim here	 and that we're hating on you for no reason. That's so sad and pitiful	 it almost makes me want to cry!! I'll tell you once again... seek professional help!!

I agree with you. People can be so cruel. They just didnt read the assesments. I've received just zeroes from one person. Do you think it is normal? I dont. I was trying so hard. and I think I made very interesting experiment and described every detail. When I gave marks to other students I have read carefully every sentence. And I have found the information that was asked during evaluation.

"I'm also taking this course (Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction) and while some of the reviews were great feedback	 some of them were brutal and downright incorrect. Some of the reviewers did not follow the instruction and there is no possiblity to react upon the review. It was difficult for me to stay motivated for this course because of this. The quality of the lectures kept me going. I also don't think that so large a part of your grade should depend on peer reviews. "
Me either.

What I'm trying to say (and probably should have phrased it better) is that I'm testing whether the same trait (darker lower loops) can also be used for diabetes detection. The lower loops generally signify everything related to the body [on a broader level	 everything materialistic - but I'll not get there]. So characteristics of these loops are used to determine health	 strength etc. (and hopefully	 in years to come	 even diseases). Hope that makes it clearer :) "
"Svetlana	 I am telling that someone has received my scores because I want to make clear that we all must to be objective.

"I know. I too wanted to know if I could eliminate maybe some topics from my preparation and even posted a question for anyone who has already taken the exam. But I can understand why they would want us to go through everything. Imagine that I must do everything today	 so... pressure's on!&nbsp; "

Thanks&nbsp;Javier!

"Something to consider is that some students here may not know how to cite references.&nbsp; Another thing to consider is that students who are not English-writers may write overly simple sentences.&nbsp; Simple sentences might show as copied from another source on a Plagiarism software...just a thought.&nbsp; <br /><br />I had one paper that did copy more than what was written independent	 they even left the citation numbers in the text but did not refer to the place the text came from.&nbsp; It was hard to assess knowing the data was not their own	 but I did it according to Alex's suggestion all other the same.&nbsp; "

"Exactly... I spent some days thinking in something interesting and now	 I'm sure	 that I will not have a good grade because I didn't used the words: variable	 dependent	 independent	 and so on.<br /><br /> "
A dummy exercise was there for about 2 weeks. Then it was removed. I think that the real assignments will be posted in future and suitable advice will be sent to all of us in due course by email.<br /> 
"I agree with the above suggestion. I hope you found it helpful. Your experiment had nearly everything it needed in it. Designing an experiment is like writing a recipe. and so clearly defined and including all the right ingredients in the right quantities. with the instructions on what do to in order to get the result. You need to know first off what are you trying to test? (the research question or hypothesis can be two way - as the one mentioned above	 or directional: maybe you want to know - will people buy more spanish wines if spanish music is being played	 or will they buy more wine if music is playing (as apposed to no music)? It is also important to quantify your sample population. As mentioned above 100 customers - will they be your first 100 customers	 or randomly selected	 will you focus on just wines of a particular price range? etc. And to do a real experiment you need to have a control group where no music is played	 a standard to compare your results to. I am happy to share my assignment with you if you think it will help	 but i would think that the next assignment would not be about designing an experiment again.<br /> "
"Do I detect a bit of an attitude? Probably not	 why would you have attitude when I'm trying to help	 right??&nbsp; Of course it's not simple!! It was an assignment	 it's not supposed to be simple. It took me a lot of hard work to get the grade I got. I didn't give you the information with the intention of doing the project for you. I gave you the information to show you that the assignment did indeed tell you exactly what they wanted of you. Having read through the course	 they assumed you remembered that you had read about experimental method experimentation. If not	 there's always the search bar. That's about as simple as I'm going to make it for you.&nbsp; :-)<br /> "
"Thank you guys and Christine I agree that at the end of the day the mini&nbsp;quizzes&nbsp;are the true mirror of whether I have understood what its being said here or not. Maybe the extra time	 since I quite enjoy the whole process	 is because I am not an English native speaker	 so lots of terminology or just words with depth there that I need to ""translate"" to myself in Greek and then link them with their meaning. But this overall is a tremendous experience. Really!&nbsp; "

"So which one is it	 homes... you say I didn't pay for the course and then you say I did. Maybe you should just continue to use your Coursera profile to pick up women.

"I agree with Carol	 very well put!<br /><br />To be completely honest	 I don't think that people should be too surprised that they expected us to clarify what our variables were. After all	 it specifically mentioned the ""independent variable"" in the assignment. It also said ""Define your terms"" so I think you can expect people to talk about dependent and independent variables.<br /><br />I was a bit surprised by the fact that we were asked to give the exact number of participants	 which I did not do	 I only spoke of a ""small group of people"" but	 then again	 it said ""Someone should be able to do your experiment exactly from your
description	"" so I can see why people would expect me to give a number as well.<br /><br />Having said that	 I still believe that it would have helped us all a lot if we had known what we would be expected to have in our text	 especially since it is very hard to infer from forum interactions with the staff what it is that they want us to do. I work as a teacher myself and I know that simply handing out an assignment can produce very different outcomes if you do not clearly state what it is you want to see in a completed assignment.<br /><br />And	 as I have said before	 especially the line ""Did the student say that the data would be analyzed?"" seems very odd to me (see above post) and I also do not understand why we can't leave any comments. In the other Coursera course I am taking at the moment I was not particularly happy with what people did with my text when they had to evaluate it	 but at least I could better understand their perspectives when I read the comments.<br /><br />And	 Carol you're absolutely right	 we're all different people - we come from different backgrounds and countries and as peer reviews don't seem to be working out too well at the moment (people seem to be rather disappointed with the results across the courses) it is all the more important that the grading criteria are clearly communicated and thoroughly questioned before they are put in place.<br /> "

"<p>Oh	 and I&#39;m glad to hear two thirds of your assigned evaluations deserved high marks. Wish I had the same luck.</p>

"Dear Kate	&nbsp;<span>below is an extract from the Coursera Pedagogical Foundations (<a href=""https://www.coursera.org/about/pedagogy"" target="""" title=""Link: https://www.coursera.org/about/pedagogy"">https://www.coursera.org/about/pedagogy</a>)&nbsp;concerning peer assessments. I think that the sentence that&nbsp;</span><b><i>I have highlighted for you</i></b> is self explanatory:<br /><br /><h2>Peer assessments</h2><p>In many courses	 the most meaningful assignments do not lend themselves easily to automated grading by a computer. For example	 in a poetry course	 we would want the students to practice critical thinking and interpretive skills by answering essay-style questions	 which do not have clear right or wrong answers. Similar issues arise when we are evaluating business plans	 engineering designs	 medical chart reviews	 or many others. This is particularly an issue in courses in the Humanities	 Social Sciences	 Business	 and other disciplines where a relatively small fraction of the content lends itself well to an auto-graded format. Given our commitment to offer courses from a broad range of disciplines	 we have invested substantial effort in developing the technology of peer assessments	 <b><i>where students can evaluate and provide feedback on each otherâ€™s work</i></b>. This technology draws on two bodies of literature: First	 the education literature on peer assessments. Following the literature on&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1662/0002-7685(2001)063%5B0474:CPR%5D2.0.CO%3B2"" target=""_blank"">student peer reviews</a>	 we have developed a process in which students are first trained using a grading rubric to grade other assessments. This has been shown to result in accurate feedback to other students	 and also provide a valuable learning experience for the students doing the grading. Second	 we draw on ideas from the literature on&nbsp;<a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=ZIPCODE51"" target=""_blank"">crowd-sourcing</a>	 which studies how one can take many ratings (of varying degrees of reliability) and combine them to obtain a highly accurate score. Using such algorithms	 we expect that by having multiple students grade each homework	 we will be able to obtain grading accuracy comparable or even superior to that provided by a single teaching assistant.</p><div><br /></div> "
"Hey good question Thomas	 and they do	 but since the spanish and the portuegese close	 I hope it helps. "
"While I can't offer this as an official answer	 I've been in other Coursera courses where there has been work to do past the end date and the course is always accessible. Actually	 usually the course is accessible long after all the assignments have been due and graded. I wouldn't worry if I were you. The end date is probably just the last of new material being posted	 not the true course end date. Think of the next week as finals period	 if you will. "
"Indeed	 thank you Loredana! "
Hi all. My name is Kinuthia from Kenya . I work as a safari manager and I like interacting with people from different backgrounds. I believe some knowledge in psychology will help me a lot. <br /> 
I think she feels her marks are in error and she wants a review.<br /> 
"EMAIL25551 No it wasn't just the browser. When I clicked the link	 my computer came up with an error and turned itself off. Also Windows running Google Chrome. "
"Anony	 Kathy didn't say she was using wisdom	 I did. I also use the rubric	 so there should be no problem. "
"That's a good idea	 Hyancinth. Not a different assignment (most of us don't have the time and have already committed substantial time to this one) but just an opportunity to resubmit this one in the light of knowing what the expectations (as per the marking rubric) actually are.<br /><br />Those who feel they have already met all the requirements could just resubmit their assignment as is	 but those who need to include some particular element or terminology etc. would have the opportunity to update their work and resubmit.<br /><br />Vote this up if you like the idea and maybe the course staff will notice!<br /> "
"Jens	 if the student suggested how the analyzing would be done rather than say the words ""the data will be analyzed""	 I gave them full credit.&nbsp; I assumed if there was a suggestion on how it would be calculated	 there is enough evidences that it would be analyzed. "
"And your experiment is truly in accordance with the scientific method! Are you connected to Psychology	 medicine in any way Caroline? "

"Vallery	 I agree with everything you write	 except one thing. You write ""the OP wasn't the first to draw blood"". Look at comment 23 on this thread. ""I already predicted a mind such as yours would come spout some 
psuedo-anarchistic rhetoric. But	  I bet there are plenty of laws you 
support and I bet most of them involve oppressing someone else in some 
way so unless you are an anarchist you have no right to complain about 
the law and if you are then there are far worse laws to complain about."" That is the first rude and degrading comment of the thread and it is written by the OP. This is what set the barre for all those comments that followed. Just wanted to clear that up. <br /><br /> "
Well said Nancy. We might as well learn Psychology via Google. It seems Google is the answer for everything or the lack of. My solution is this: cut the tried hard fancy interactive OLI textbook and just give us *a* textbook to read.<br /> 
"The problem may have to do with browser settings	 I am not sure.<br />These are the criteria.<br /><br />1. Levels of independent variable are manipulated	 or experimental and control conditions exist. variable identification / definition are present.<br /><br />2. The hypothetical construct is the object of study	 and behavior is being measured. Variable identification and definition are present.<br /> "

"Having taken several courses with peer assessments	 I've learned that as long as I got a passing grade I should be happy. I've also learned that many students get marked down if they're left to wander in the dark. Whenever students knew exactly what was expected of them	 they got higher grades. <br /> "

This quiz question has now now been re-assessed correctly. 
"Thank you for the reminder Emilie	 I had completely forgotten about it... "
I also don't see the assignement 
sorry I meant top right..<br /> 
I completely agree with you!!<br />Thanks for making my point clearer ;)

"Yes!! I did it!<br />It was fun and&nbsp;although I am a physicist... I work with neuroscience	 so for me	 my score was better than I could imagine.<br /><br /> "
"Haha	 cheers :D "
Hi Kal. Great resource and great effort. You have saved me the trouble of cut and paste of weekly modules into one document that I could easily review. In addition I also do the exercises in the OLI text. So you are not detracting from my study process but actually consolidating all the modules for review. I'm sure this is very helpful for many many students. Please continue to do it. This does not replace but rather supplements&nbsp; OLI.<br /> 
"Coco Xu	<br /><br />Q-6: Answer is in Lecture Video 3-3 Receptive Fields (01:23)<br />Q-8: Answer is in OLI Text book page # 68.<br /> "
"I join the thanks of course	 but this comment stood out to me. The thank you at the end of every video got me too! I'd be watching paying attention and the professor would have a meaningful look on his face then suddenly this smile and thank you out of no where I always finished a video with a smile on my face too! "
"If I had spent money for a Signature Track and received an unfair assessment	 I would definitely find someone to speak with.&nbsp; Some one randomly giving bad scores out of spite could cost you the money spent on the Signature Track upgrade. "
"Hi Professor Smith!&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />I'm talking about the video in the OLI textbook. It's on page 28	 about halfway down	 and the video is called Function of Neurotransmitters. About 1:05 into the video it says that less than 50 have been identified	 which confused me because you DID say over a 100. <br /><br />Thanks for clearing that up! :-)<br />&nbsp; <br /> "
Then perhaps we should ALL make a pact to give each other the highest grades when assessing??!! It could be OUR turn to see how THEY react!! Two can play the experiment game!&nbsp; ;-)<br /> 
Yawn 
"Yes please! I studied a lot	 but I'm italian and I have some difficulties with English... "
The only explanation that I found is that some assesments were graded only by one person and others by several people. I only have one score from a peer and I donÂ´t think that is fair that someone received a zero just because some person (maybe the only one that graded a work) didn't want to dedicate the time to evaluate. I hope that this doesn't happen in the second assesment.&nbsp; 
"Pedro	<br />I agree that we understood the rubric differently. My understanding is that it is a pointer to discuss how heritability prevails over the environment	 even if a child is shifted to a culturally different environment.<br /> "
"Well	 I don't know what to say... What a stubborn creature you are	 Javier!))<br />And by the way	 it's not about the whole world	 just this particular community. :)<br /> "
"Some of the coursera courses do have an extra assessment to be added to the top of the score. I recently attended the 'AIDS' course by Emory university wherein they had this facility. It ended up in the maximum possible score being 125% and actually gave out certificates with that kind of score. For example	 I personally got the certificate saying121% "
I think they have not been released yet.&nbsp; There is another extension so we are likely going to be waiting longer still.&nbsp; 
this refers to behavioral genetics that studies the relative effects of nature and experience. 
"Anon who says the OP was the first to draw blood	<br />Yes	 I see what you mean. That comment by the OP was the first to be outright insulting.<br /><br />To the other Anon	 <br />Yes	 I wasted about 15 minutes gathering up the OP's comments. I wanted to double-check that I wasn't exaggerating how often he/she was nasty. Perhaps people seeing it all in one place will see the futility of trying to express their opinion. Tread here only if you want to be attacked by the insult puppet. Haha!<br /><br />NAME1806950	~<br /> "

Whoever the Anonymous person is is obviously nasty to everyone and can't even state their name because they are truly aware that they way they are being is wrong and that is why they have to stay Anonymous. &nbsp;If you are going to take classes with people all over the world learn how to treat people and not insult them. 
"Ty Yusif! I appreciate your help here. I think these classes are really good. I am looking forward to taking a few more classes soon	 I am motivated too	 I wasn't sure I would be able to keep myself doing my studies when I wasn't in a classroom setting but I actually am keeping up with it. Cant wait to take a few more classes now! <br /> "
"I guess that they are trying to keep it very strict and preffessional	 just like if it where on the campus. "
"I'm a new anon here	 not posted yet.<br /><br />Even it was interesting to read all this posts it bothers in the way we are seeing our fellows&nbsp;arguing and making them&nbsp;uncomfortable. It also bothers to see such a sweet fellow like Nancy	 who talked so kindly being attacked like that. (yes you were offensive to her)<br /><br /><b>Who are you</b> (for who ever this fits) <b>to know what disorders does the others here have or not?</b><br /><br />Like Vallery I ask:<br />What do you really really want from all of this? are you having fun? are you really worried with your grade on peer assessment? <b>what are you doing in order to achieve your goal?</b><br /><br />if this is to get fun and you're getting it	 well	 then you got it. If it's to get your&nbsp;colleagues angry	 you got it	 if it's to see how many arrows down you can get	 you can try harder	 I think you can do better ;). It's to be famous? You're anon. if it's to have fellows who care for your peer assess. lol I don't think it is	 is it?<br /><br />if you want the rules of the course to change... did it? we will arrive June still here discussing disorders	 disabilities	 laws	 etc oh it can be entertainment ""Introduction to psychology as a science - the forum garden"" 1st Season :D<br /><br />I guess all this is a&nbsp;reflection&nbsp;of your disability? If it is	 what are you doing to get better? kicking those who were kind?<br />And if you get anxiety with peer assessments why aren't you here too? It sure didn't stopped you here	 right? (I know this doesn't count for your grade but the issue isn't the grade as if it was the professor grading the assessment you wouldn't be here	 the issue is ""the others"" so the question is valid)<br /><br />Get well and good luck for your peer assessments. I'm <b>anxious </b>to read your answer :D:D:D<br /><br />Xena<br />(and by the way	 I don't agree&nbsp;with the peer assessments being the greater grade... 40% and the final exam 30% and quiz 30% but it's not this ""caos"" that will change that	 I guess coursera could create votes - like we do on facebook - for when there is a situation to know how many students think X and how many think Y	 wouldn't it be great?) "
"A commendable idea Phoebe	 however all the work and support in the world is not going to help if our peers don't know how to grade our papers!! You've seen their comments. Most of them are so pissed off over Assignment 1 that they'll downgrade just for revenge!<br /> "
"Ok Alex	 since the survey isn't relevant to the quizzes	 this clears things up. Thx "
"<p>Yes	 I&#39;m really enjoying the OLI	 as well! The fact that you can interact with it far outways the minus of not being able to download it to print etc... I also like having the 2 levels of questions	 first the blue set and then the green. It really gives you a chance to know what you&#39;ve learned. </p>
 "
"Phoebe	 I tried to look up more classes that used this type of textbook. While I did find some	 the classes seemed too hard for me. "
"Oh	 OK you are a know-it-all. You even managed to declare my political views AND my opinions about law.

I don't care about US laws because I live in another continent (there are other countries out there you know).

No	 I really think you are just trolling (talking about law and nonsense	 you just want to provoke others	 maybe you're bored	 maybe you do it on a regular basis).

Shame on me	 I forgot No 1 rule. "
I choose not to engage with someone who is yelling at me. That's my last comment on the subject. 
"Sandy	 try to change your browser...I had same problem with Mozilla but everything was good with Chrome...Good luck!<br /> "
"Ok	 what I've got from all I read:<br /><br />Phi is a kind of ""magic"" that our visual cortex does. You have 2 images separated by 1 mm	 and alternating them quickly enough	 your visual cortex will create the&nbsp;blurred&nbsp;""image"" on the 0	1 mm	 0	2 on 0	3 etc	 so there's the magic	 you didn't have any image on 0	1 and 0	2 etc but you ""saw"" as they were there.<br />On beta there's no ""magic"" you see what's there	 you perceive all images	 your sense is giving you all there is.<br />On Phi	 your perception made the ""magic"" so that you ""see"" animation.<br /><br />I still have doubts on the notebook example but with that I think if you pass the images too quickly you'll have the Phi if you slow down as much as it's necessary to perceive the differences in the pages you have no Phi	 it's Beta then.<br /><br /> "
"If you really are interested in finding out about MOOCstudents	 you should extend the deadline for End of Week survey until after the quiz deadline. - I understand that the survey is not related to the quiz - however	 I struggle constantly not to fall too much behind. Today I start to study week 5 (in week 6)	 but the survey for week 5 is already closed. So I cannot tell you about workload and time consumption. It seems to me that this way you will lose the assessments of some students	 notwithstanding what is described as ""intent"".<br /> "
"Hi Christine	<br /><br />I see the OP is still at it. How many weeks now? <br /><br />I wonder if being belligerent	 obtuse	 and aggressively rude and insulting are tactics that work for him at home and in the workplace. Do you imagine him as a lout bullying everyone around him or as a smarmy nose-in-the-air snot dishing out insulting quips? Here in the forums he comes across like an angry toddler with no impulse control. I imagine him in diapers	 all red in the face	 throwing himself down on the floor and frantically blubbering accusations and insults in an attempt to manipulate people into giving him what he wants. Poor baby. He cries and cries and nobody cares. It's reached the point where he sounds like a toddler frantically screaming ""I hate you mommy!""&nbsp;Like you said	 Christine... ""It isn't working.""&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm too busy to join in on the fun here very often. Even if you don't see me in the forums	 rest assured	 I will finish this class. I've gotten 100%	 80%	 90%	 90%	 and 100% on the quizzes thus far and am already done with my writing assignment (in under 600 words). I was tempted to come up with an experiment regarding how long responding to an online troll could keep an argument going. How long do you think the longest meaningless argument has lasted in a forum on any topic? Probably for years. What do you imagine the topic would be? Which way the toilet paper roll should be put on the holder? Ha-ha!<br /><br />See ya later Christine!&nbsp;<br /><br />NAME1806950.~ "
i also got 9.... same happened with me....... 
"Indeed. I think that if professor Anderson has the time and energy for it	 maybe we could take apart some of the most important aspects and objects of Psychology and then step by step learn them in more depth. But	 of course	 this demands lecture videos and OLI material. But I wish we could expand on this course and continue with Mr.Anderson our journey into this field. "

Yes! 85.8!!!<br />During a very busy period..<br />How&nbsp; did you do?<br /> 
"<h5>&nbsp;In response to Fernanda</h5><div>Some of the coursera courses do have an extra assessment to be added to the top of the score.

It would be ideal but I'm afraid it's a bit unrealistic. :)<br />I have another suggestion. Let's ask that <b>the weight of peer assessment</b> in the overall course grade were decreased. It is too unreliable to cost 40%!<br /> 
Georgia tech has demonstrated they can overcome obstacles! They have proved it by extending the deadline to&nbsp;5:00 pm EDT on June 25<span>. Thanks a lot!</span> 
Please advise if there is any extension?<br />thanks 
"I agree	 Svetlana.<br />I had the same issue with the submissions I evaluated. Yes	 they met the requirements but there were some fundamental flaws and they were not always presented clearly. I had to give them the marks based on the rubric	 but they were not necessarily good or valid experiments.<br /> "
"Some good points	 Javier; however	 I was addressing the issues of dealing with the people rather than the course structure.&nbsp; I am not asking the college to fix anything	 I am suggesting a higher level of communication with the students of Coursera.&nbsp; Generally	 people need to feel that their concerns are being heard and understood.&nbsp; In my opinion	 if UNIVERSITY staff does not see a problem	 then they are definitely out-of-touch with the human side of this course.&nbsp; <br /><br />I like being able to take a quiz more than once as I used it to refresh my memory before the final exam.&nbsp; If the quizzes are open for retaking	 even if the scores don't count	 that makes this method of review possible.&nbsp; 70 percent seems low to me	 but it might be marked so to compensate for the instability of the peer assessment grading.&nbsp; I also like the OLI&nbsp; text.&nbsp; (The company that makes this text also makes texts for other courses.)&nbsp; "
Shhhhhhhhh... 
Well.. I would like for someone (Hari maybe?) to read my experiment after I've conducted it. The comment will be helpful. How can someone contact someone else through here? Is it possible? 
It says to use the experimental method which includes analyzing the results!<br />

"Ok Alex	 thx for the reply. Just wanted to make sure	 so I go by the book.

I agree&nbsp; 
"I think I understand what you mean (I am currently doing the statistics course as well). However	 as I can see from what you've described	 you still have the hypothesis in your psychological experiment which is not null - your prediction that something WILL happen. <br /><br /><br /> "
"Hi Carla - congratulations on being brave enough to try! I'm scrolling through and reading everyone's bios	 and seeing that you will have a lot of 'English as a Second Language' company... so my tip for you would be to feel free to ask questions	 especially about language comprehension	 because my guess is that many people will be interested in the answers! Good luck! I've traveled to your country and it is beautiful :) "

"Christine	 I hear you and I find your reply and comments to be of much help. While you mention all this	 I kept thinking that <b>maybe it would be much more helpful if there was a text</b> <b>addressed to novice participants&nbsp;such as myself	</b>&nbsp;<b>through which we would be notified as to whether we must memorize the names and terminology or not	 if we can go back at any point and consult with OLI and so on</b>. To be honest I thought till now that I had to absorb everything that's in OLI	 memorize everything and learn all the names and terminology by heart. So maybe this isn't the case and still when taking the ""exams"" and quizzes it's allowed to look up my notes.<b> But that is something	 a basic help text	 that I would like to get from Alex </b>or the other members of the professor's team. In any case because in my eyes this is a tremendous experience	 I have promised myself to get as far as I can and as my time permits and well	 it is a challenge to see how things are done! So thank you once again for the reply.&nbsp;&nbsp; "
"Big Font	<br />I believe that Kathy means Where does it say&nbsp;the <b>original</b> assignment must say the words ""the data will be analyzed""?<br /><br />Also	 I'd like to see you scroll down to where an anonymous person signed ""not as simple as it seems"" and answer his or her question.<br /><br />Anonymous 9 "
I had access for a short time at work but couldn't go on and on my phone and that was it when I posted that I did not have internet connection at my house and after i left work couldn't access even using my phone. &nbsp;so if you want to get down to details that it what it is and if I could have done the evaluations like the first paper I would have. Also about the degrees was only stating it to back myself up because of your rude comments. &nbsp;And if you think I believe you care about me getting better NOT. &nbsp;This is a class where people should be polite and considerate to EVERYONE and obviously you don't know how to do that.

"Hi guys	 I am NAME2680897 Isaacs from a beautiful small island in the Caribbean	 St. Lucia.

"People like the anon above often ARE wrong about other people	 because they are too involved in their own woes to listen or care about what others have to say or deal with. It's all about them. <br /><br />Christine	 I will have your back at any time. <br /><br />As for why I would like the certificate	 I have been out of circulation for many years because of my bipolar disorder	 so any education I had is now obsolete. After many tries I'm finally on a treatment regime that gives me some hope that I can hold down a real job. But I have to be up to date with my knowledge. The certificates will help show that I am! <br /><br />These courses are for many types of people who have many types of needs... except those who aren't willing to do the work!! But my choice to take this program was not with the intent that the course would be making exceptions for me.

"Hari tyvm	 I rechecked but the only thing about assignment 2 is under week 6	 this is the cut and paste: We should be announcing the second written assignment later this week. 
Instead of opening it after peer evaluations of the first written 
assignment are finished	 we would like to give everyone as much time as 
possible to complete it.//// I find nothing else. I have been watching since week 6 had that posted and there has been nothing here. Is it possible to do a cut and paste and let me see the assignment so I can start work on it? Either way thanks again Hari your help has been appreciated a number of times on here! <br /><br />I did go back and found this:<br /><h4>Written Assignment 2</h4>Opens: <b>Monday	 May 20</b><br />
Submission deadline: <b>Friday	 June 7</b><br />
Evaluation deadline: <b>Sunday	 June 16</b><br />But there is nothing stating what the assignment is. I am guessing nothing is posted yet	 because of the other post I assumed something would be written about what the assignment would be so we could start on it. Ill leave this alone till tomorrow and hope something will be posted what our assignment is.&nbsp; ty! <br /> "
"Yes	 Suzanne	 I agree. Comments would have given an understanding of why the particular grade was given. I believe the Professor mentioned that this would be included in the next assignment. :-)<br /> "

thankyou hari..:) 
"I understood it as this:<br /><b>section 1</b>:&nbsp;""Discuss the 'nature versus nurture' question.""<br />You should describe what the fundamental question is here. To what aspects of psychology does it apply? What have various psychologists said in response to it? What conclusions	 if any	 have been reached regarding this question?<br /><br /><b>Section 2</b>: ""Indicate how we collect data to address this issue.""<br />What methods (studies	 research	 etc.) have been employed to attempt to answer the ""nature versus nurture"" question?<br /><br /><b>Section 3</b>: ""Pick one of the two constructs listed. Is the construct being studied determined by genetics or by the environment through experience?""<br /><span>State as precisely as possible the extent to which your chosen construct is determined by nature or by nurture. The important part here is&nbsp;</span><b>how you make your case</b><span>&nbsp;for whether your construct is determined more by nature or by nurture. It's an excellent idea to refer back to the methods from the previous section and discuss how each method could be (or already has been) applied to answer the ""nature versus nurture"" question&nbsp;</span><i>for this specific construct</i><span>.<br /><br />So	 previous section would be the studies/methods you indicated on section 2<br />hope it helps<br /></span> "

"Phoebe	 I think ""culture"" does apply to schizophrenia in two ways: 1. environmental factors as triggers	 2. incidence worldwide being similar (hence genetic). In my essay I argued that it was ""nature vs nurture"" was a philosophical concept being subjected to scientific study (hence bull*%&amp;#). I didn't like this essay subject	 I don't think it was fair and the marking rubric is weird - 2 marks for genes and 3 for culture? Sorry for being anon	 but I may have given my identity away to essay markers.<br /> "
"Dear Elvis	&nbsp;I'm being honest with you. I consider your essay better than mine (above)	 and I received a 15. I would have given you a 20.<br /><br />I suggest you include peer comments and grades	 as I did with mine.<br /><br />But evaluation is not what we think we deserve	 but what others think we deserve. Eg	 in ""Gamification"" I got 10-10	 8.-10 and 10-10 in my three essays. And I considered my second essay the best one of all three	 but it ""only"" got &nbsp;8-10. The same with ""The Modern and the Postmodern"". I ""only"" got 6-9 in my last essay	 but for me it was my best one.<br /><br />Anyway	 I should not complain about peer evaluation. I consider (in my 15 finished coursera courses till now)	 it has been pretty fair and just.<br /><br />Cheers.&nbsp; "
"Regardless of the ""Pedagogy"" claims &amp; rationale	 accurate feedback and scoring has not been my experience of Coursera peer-assessments. I refute the ""crowd sourcing"" analogy because the peer assessments do not include ""many"" ratings - usually only a maximum of 5. Five is not ""many"" and is unlikely to result in a ""highly accurate score""	 especially when the assessors may be unskilled	 may not have fully understood the assignment (or the material) themselves	 may not be marking in their native language - etc. etc. etc.	&nbsp; ""<i><b>students are first trained using a
 grading rubric"" </b></i>is not even worthy of comment.<br /><br />MOOCs can really only be assessed	 both in terms of practicality and fairness	 using (well-constructed) computer-based assessments.<br /><br /> "
The 1.5 and the 4.5 are the average of marks given by the different peers. &nbsp; 
"Helcio	 this would be a basis for a good experiment. You'd need a control group	 let's say	 customers buying wine when unrelated music is playing	 something like classical music	 or even no music at all.

"Wonderful&nbsp;post Helen Taylor.<br />I would suggest also some music (only ambient)	 but a music with around 60bps	 like some of Handel (Water Music) it can be any kind of music but in this ritm it will help bringing you to alpha brainwaves where we can focus. higher then 60 bps -&gt; higher brainwaves (beta) -&gt; less focus<br />each one has to find the right music and the right level of sound for them	 some people may need absolute silence	 but if this is not your case I hope this helps along with what Helen Taylor suggested.<br /><br />PS - Do you know the story of the Water music&nbsp;from Handel?

"If a trait has the same variability across different cultures	 it must be mostly heritable.<br />And this method wasn't discussed in OLI textbook (if I missed it	 someone give me a link	 please). And of course I haven't write about it. :)<br /><br />The rubric is too specific	 it assesses the advanced knowledge rather than basic one. If you didn't get some subtle points but has a firm understanding of basic things	 you'll still get zero. It's up to the instructor to decide on grading policy (learning is a labour :D) but I think students should be warned of it beforehand. Moreover in the MOOC!<br /> "

"<p>I've finished only one yet (actually two but one is still not closed before the hard deadline	 my grades should be enough for completion :D). It had a peer evaluated final exam. The rubric was exposed beforehand and we were trained to use it (the professor is very conscious of what he is doing and has an idea to use peer assessment as a part of learning	 i.e. you master the material best when you evaluate others). But in spite of it there were the same problems. We had different concepts of what is right	 some were too harsh	 some too light	 some were incompetent in studied material. With anonymous grading you are not even safe from freakish misanthropic trolls who would deliberately spoil your mark!</p><p>And about this course... Well	 I never met one with so many spiteful anonymouses in pack! XD I think psychology draws in both the best and the most unbearable persons of the whole population.))</p><p>And the rubric... When I saw it I felt that I could have spent on the assignment even less amount of time than I'd done. The rubric should be changed (I really do hope that this course will be repeated!)	 it has a demotivating effect on students!<br />  </p> "
"Katherina	 do not un-enroll from the course! Why should your self-respect depend on someone's spite	 or stupidity	 or mistake? Is the certificate all that you would get from the course? Your emotions (though just!) will pass	 but your knowledge will stay with you for a long time after. The OLI materials are truly great!<br />Maybe in your particular case you may request that your assignment would be regraded by the staff? Or something like that.<br />And why are you telling that someone received your score points? You are feeling robbed but why shift your frustration on others? It's not the way. :)<br />Don't let them make you lose your spirit! You've done a great job and it's not in vain!<br /> "

That was an awesome course! I really liked Dr. Chuck. He was very professional! <br />

Alex has finally spoken and put and end to this argument. Why can't we accept it and let it be? Only on free online courses like Coursera can we whine and complain on and on. Do you think we could do this in the traditional universities??? Enough already !<br /> 
Considering we don't know WHY it happened this time - we kinda then just have to assume that it'll happen next time... and just give up any control of 40% of our grade with no indication on what we did wrong? &nbsp;I just think this needs addressed offically. 
I do have the same problem!! 
:D I also speak portuguese :) Nice to meet you and thank you :)<br /><br />You can add me on fb if you want :) NAME3124335 NAME3124335 Secher Valdes 
I think this issue should be taken up with coursera staff.&nbsp; 
"I agree that we should have known what was expected. Based on the 20 papers I've evaluated	 a score can be high without having a clue about putting an experiment together and some that score low had better content than the high scorers. The criteria for scoring doesn't even include things like&nbsp;whether there were confounding elements and yet that was a specific part of the assignment. I think designing something with no confounding elements takes a lot more effort than including the number of participants! This is not an arguement against peer review; with the right criteria and a more specific and accurate way to score	 it can be a good experience. "
Thank you. 
"Still Î¦Î¯Î»Î¹Ï€Ï€Îµ	 I think that that is exactly what the want from us... The structure	 the outline	 the theory. "
"Thank you Svetlana	 indeed in this case the video is not necessary to understand but in other cses might be.<br />Anyway	 thank you again!<br /> "
"Hmmmmmm... You're wrong. This may be a FREE class for you	 but some people actually paid for it and they have the right to expect proper grading! Also this assignment was based on the EXPERIMENTAL METHOD	 not the scientific method. :-)<br /> "
Sums it up perfectly!!!<br /> 
"""is it jealousy because you yourselves aren't disabled?"".

This is so inconsiderate and insulting that I truly believe you should be banned from the course. "
"I agree that no one should be giving marks on their belief of plagiarism;&nbsp;however	 some did.&nbsp; The truth	 my truth anyway	 is that the software used to test for plag. is flawed	 seriously flawed.&nbsp; I tested it against my own creative writing	 there was no citations and no quoting of outside resources.&nbsp; The material I used has never been published in any form.&nbsp; The software returned a score of ""not original work"".&nbsp; It also claimed there was grammar and spelling errors.&nbsp; There were not errors in that paper	 I recheck with MS Word and it returned a clean report.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any student that graded based on believed plagiarism (plag) should be penalized equally.&nbsp; Especially so if the paper they down graded turned out to show only errors in citation and referencing.&nbsp; Legally	 the copied words must have been taken and placed with the intent of fooling others into believing those words were written by the individual rather than the original writer before it is considered plagiarism.&nbsp; Without the intent to deceive	 copying other work without giving ownership is nothing more than an academic error.&nbsp; Because I am a writer	 I tend to consider plag very seriously; however	 in fairness	 nothing written by students within this course is intended to be published.&nbsp; It is considered for personal or academic use.&nbsp; "
EMAIL27764 I made the same error as you. But I realized in hindsight that the keyword in the question was *regularly* and not starts (that we both seem to have used in our reasoning) :)

"I think it wouldn't be too hard to have the grading software search for zeros.&nbsp; It might even be that someone who gives too many zeros will be flagged as a ""bot"".&nbsp; One never knows what happens in the background; I think it would be best to follow the advice of the staff. "
"There are two ways to do it:<br />GradeA/23*0	2+ GradeB/15*0	2= Assignments score<br /><br />or&nbsp;<br /><br />(Grade A/23+GradeB/15)/2*0	4= Assignments score -careful with the parentheses here. The second one takes the average of both assignments	 if you want to know it.<br /><br />It is the same	 whatever works for you.&nbsp; "
And what am I supposed to be insinuating? 
"The problem with the rubric is that it does not address many aspects that I would have expected - not least of which is the actual quality of the experiment.<br />Regardless of the quality or otherwise of the rubric - if we didn't know what the rubric was going to assess	 how could we submit an assignment that met it?<br /> "

Yes it does. And your argument makes no sense. Chill out.

"If you wrote a great paper	 then there's no need to plagiarize and your effort will be reflected to some degree in the final work	 for which you will be rewarded.

"The 2 assignments are worth 40% of your mark	 so it is fair to assume 
that this one assignment is worth 20% of your overall mark. It is 
indicated on the Assignment section that no late assignment will be

assignments	 so if you can	 you should get working on that	 to get some 
points at least... but I am not sure these will count towards your assignment's grade if you haven't submitted an assignment in the first place...<br /> "

"The certificate will have whatever name you used to sign onto Coursera	 the course name and university.<br /> "
Sigh. And that's why peer marking essays is problematic. I've only been able to give one full-marks so far and that was by bending the rubric. But they really understood the process we've learned in the course and made an actual argument!<br />

Hi Doc!....welcome to the best place for you learning needs! 
"<p>In some Coursera courses	 weekly peer assessments (sometimes up to 4 a week)	 account for 100% of the mark and they function just fine. I blame people&#39;s unfamiliarity with the system more than the system itself. Perhaps a Coursera introductory course should be offered before people enroll for courses. </p>

"Know Thyself is terrific! Not what I thought it would be but very	 very interesting.<br /><br />NAME1806950.~ "
I do however agree with you that 60% should be enough to pass the course and hope for you that you have made it.<br />See please my remarks about the attribution of the first 10 questions in the final exam to the total of the quiz scores. It may help you pass the 70% treshold. Good luck.<br /> 
Hey! Is your name Alex? If not... why are you here? I asked Alex to answer on my question. Try to understand me... I dont care how much scores other people received. I did my job and evaluated 3 works with a good marks. Other is not my problem. I did great job as I think. And I deserved good evaluation...&nbsp; 
"Dear Hari	 thank you for replying on my query	 but it still remains the same. When i click on 'Go to Assignment' on peer assessment page	 the next page that opens is absolutely blank.

I got a score of 21. I am happy!<br /><br /> 
Manoj--I ran your two scores through the same calculations you used with averaging and came up with 32.6.&nbsp; I think the difference between your calculations and mine&nbsp;is in the rounding.&nbsp; I entered my numbers into a spreadsheet so there was no rounding except in the final display which was 32.63% for the scores you provided. 
"I had to have a go at both to realise there was a difference! I meant mirror image it turns out	 just spelling words backwards in a sentence that's still going in the same direction is really uncomfortable! To mirror-write I just have to ""flip"" my brain	 same for upsidedown. Like you	 I don't think I ever practiced	 but equally I don't recall believing in Santa Claus	 so who knows ;)<br />Survey results so far: My sister says ""she can do it but she has to concentrate""	 my boyfriend says ""I can do it	 but not as fast as the right way up"" and also ""can we go to bed it's 1am"" ;)<br />Night night :) "
I finished my quiz &nbsp;and final exam in &nbsp;an excellent &nbsp;way... but the peer assessment make me disappoint &nbsp;twice 
"<p>I only got one set of numbers	 too.  All whole numbers.  I don&#39;t have a problem with the score	 but I am disappointed that only one person graded the assignment.  I did six.  I wonder what the completion rate was on this portion of the assignment...</p>

"Amy	 <br />1. Will you please detail me how to do MBA online	 I am interested.&nbsp;<br />2. Anonymous 1 has apologised. I think I read somewhere in psychology classes only that if you review your own comments a few days later	 you would not agree with them. (learning number one from this issue)<br />3. Learning number two: communication must be on always. See if you guide me	 I may end up MBA like you!<br />4. Learning no 3: Before commenting adversely we must check who is at the other end.

Good decision :-)<br /> 
"Can you post a link or say which thread has this post	 I've only seen the average of the scores. "
"I completely agree with the post	 above. I've done numerous Coursera courses and have found there's been far more onus on learning the course material via weekly video lectures (which have always been made informative and engaging by the respective lecturers of each course). These courses have	 naturally	 had recommended readings and homework assignments too	 but when contrasted with this course	 I can't help but feel that the weighting placed on studying the OLI textbook (as opposed to watching video lectures) is far too substantial when compared with the mode of delivery of other Coursera courses.<br /><br />I think this course would prove more engaging (and the information easier to digest) if more course material were to be introduced and discussed via video lectures	 rather than asking students to sit for hours in front of the OLI textbook trying to process information and then completing the not particularly user-friendly ""Did I get this?"" exercises.<br /><br /> "
might look at OLI pages 181-182 to help you get an idea. <br /> 
"I tried to review my answers after the deadline	 but couldn't.<br />Is there any chance to do that? "
"obviously yes	 all famous MEDICAL JOURNALS like PUIBMED and BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL are only available online	 you have to use internet. But donot use the same lines or copy paste	 otherwise you will not get grades for your assignemnt. Use your own words. "
"Then can't you tell me	 please	 why the rubric doesn't provide its evaluation? One could use ""telegraphic style"" and still get full points for including right words. At the same time if a student focused on other aspects of the problem he or she will be degraded no matter how consistent and argumentative his or her text is.<br />Personally	 I feel that 60% of my work (=time) is a waste and was excessive.<br /><br />I strongly agree that writing is more valuable and indicative type of assignment than tests and these lazy students should be forced to use their minds :D	 but there are huge problems with introducing it into MOO course (where	 by the way	 evaluation is performed not by the experts).<br />A lot of students feel frustrated and demotivated	 and it's not the best outcome of the task. And it's a pity because there are few psychology courses at Coursera (I've counted three) and this particular one is very informative.<br /> "
"I beg to differ. The course started out amazing. Well-spoken professor	 OLI is genius. Then we were deserted. Too much of a work load for our TA. The only reason I can imagine for the stunt he pulled with this last assessment is that he's busy with his own finals and has left us to fend for ourselves. This IS a fiasco for anyone who has worked hard for 10 weeks only to fail now because of the questionable management of this last assignment. Yes	 it was a great topic. Too bad the lies Alex told us to ""help"" us	 only contributed to wasting our time and space. And not giving any other choice then either they've got it or they don't	 no middle choice. This could very possibly bury most of the students here. This needs to be addressed. "

"Ok. Too bad. I saw in this same thread that some changes had been made for some students and I thought it could be possible to revise that point of Assignment 1. If it is not possible at this point	 there's nothing that can be done. I really did enjoy the course. <br /><br />Thank you!<br /> "
"I had the same result on the ""Learn by Doing"" for the JND.&nbsp; I assumed that I incorrectly judged too many sames or differences to get an accurate measurement of the JND	 especially as I was guessing for most of the responses.&nbsp; My old eyes just could not see the differences in the second (RED) set of circles.<br /> "
"Faizi	<br /><br />I thank Srividya for her clarification.<br /><br />There is no uniformity in Coursera for allowing access to the Course materials even after the course duration is over. Some sponsors allow it while some others remove the contents. Therefore	 I suggested a solution to download them now.<br /><br />OLI text is available without any account whatsoever in the link provided in my earlier post.<br /> "

"It is hard not to notice that two persons were giving me points	 and the third one didnt. I made experiment by myself. And not just theory. I even made it in life. I didnt steal ideas. In my work I even mention sources &nbsp;that pushed me on these experiment. I wrote carefully about each day of experiment and gave detailed characteristic to everything. Maybe my English is not so perfect. But I think people can understand me. Am I right? By the way... before experiment I carefully read 10-15 articles that show us how we can describe psychological experiment in details. And of course I listened to our professor and read OLI "
"Kathy	 I wish I could give you 100 upticks! I did the same. If it was obviously going to be analyzed	 I gave them credit. And just for the added pleasure	 I scored more than 30 papers. "

"Thank you! But	 as Alex points out	 it may give away the answer (which I can't know until I see the explanation	 so what can I do?...).<br /><br />I guess I'll drop the questions that I obviously wouldn't understand without the dictionary. If I really don't know	 it won't do me much good	 anyway.<br /><br />In some questions	 though	 I excluded all the wrong answers	 even though I didn't know the word for the correct one. If I can say what the answer <i>isn't</i>	 I guess it shows I learned something	 right? "

"I hadn't heard of the plagiarism checker before. I ran mine through one and my work is 99% original content (the only exception is part of the reference section). To give you an idea	 one of the students I penalized for plagiarism has supposedly 50% original content	 and that's because he/she shifted a few words around; the true percentage is probably much lower. The second student I penalized for plagiarism only has 35% original content	 and again	 that's just because a couple of words were shifted around. The true percentage in that case is probably less than 10%.<br /> "

"Thank you professor Anderson Smith	 I had understood that age also cause degradation of the cilia	 but it just happens because we have more time exposed to noises	 then it's possible to someone with more then 65 years to have not loose 40% of the cilia right? if the person had a very quiet life (not very noisy)?<br /> "
"Susanne you're right	 doing an essay definitely helps us to think of what we're doing more. It's just that on all my essays even if I try I never seem to do as well as I originally hoped.

"<p>Hahahaha	 there you go again. I don&#39;t care what you think	 and I am sure as heck not going to allow myself to be bullied by the likes of you. YOU DON&#39;T GET TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO Is that clear enough for you? You don&#39;t get to tell ANYONE WHAT TO DO. If it drives you crazy not having that control of this course then sobeit	 you don&#39;t get to piss on my parade (was that sludge enough for you? Am I pressing your buttons yet?) If you don&#39;t want to talk	 why can&#39;t you shut up? Now let me tell YOU something. You may be used to bullying your way through life in your neck of the woods but here you should try to be more civilized. As it has been mentioned several times	 if you hadn&#39;t been so rude	 you would have had plenty of support. Heck	 we probably could have had a petition going. But you had to be so arrogant that all you got was hate! Now I&#39;ve watched you self-destruct for far too long. It no longer interests me. I find it kind of depressing because I think even if you wanted to stop	 you couldn&#39;t. But you are really starting to detract from my enjoyment of this course and I&#39;m really not about to let that happen. So without further adieu	 I&#39;m going to find something interesting to do... in other words anything but talk with you. This is out of your control	 live with it or not	 I honestly don&#39;t care	 but I will tell you one thing. Ditch the attitude or this will be a very	 very long course for you. </p>

"A couple of our classmates came up with titles like those of 'fictional stories'. I gave out a sample to emphasize that the title would supplement the experimental design.<br /><br />As Professor Smith wrote	 we could take inspirations from the experiments inside the videos	 but not expected to copy them.

"Yes	 thanks a lot to everyone! I "
"I am not able to access the lectures on week&nbsp; 6. It shows them but when I click on the first it takes me to the lecture videos and only shows them up to five	 I have replayed a couple of the earlier videos so I know that its ok to play	 they just arent showing up now. I d/l the materials but still nothing going on. its a couple hours into the 8 am EST. maybe its some technical difficulty. <br /> "
you shouldn't say that or think that also where did you see that its stated that because I'm trying to find that about myself 
"I haven't been talking to you because we haven't been commenting on the same threads	 I guess. I'm sorry you feel a bit down. I saw that you are in some of the same courses as I	 so we'll meet again for sure. What do you think of the Fantasy and Science course so far? Dracula is one of my favourite stories.&nbsp; :-)<br /> "
I'm in! 
Good to know there are some dutch people here as well  :-) 
"EMAIL12016 Comments are usually just an explanation of why the reviewer chose the mark they gave to paper. It helps to have an explanation of why I made a ""3"" instead of a ""5."" There is nothing illegal about this and	 as someone has already pointed out	 the only person who reads the remark is the person who submitted the paper it's written about. If you received your assignment back and the score was 19 out of a possible 23	 wouldn't you like to know why? "
I'm guessing we have too many students that's why they decided to implement peer assessments. They probably don't have enough staff strength to mark all our assignments within the course period. 
"I know you're trying to do this without losing face	 but no one is buying your excuses. You've been too... what do you call someone like you without offending everyone on the thread...? Oh well	 I'm sure you get what I'm trying to say. But any chance you may have had of ""leaving gracefully"" is really not going to work	 as long as you continue to behave badly. I'm going to come right out and ask you	 do you have APD? I'm not trying to be mean now	 but I'd love to hear a bit more about it from someone who actually has the illness. Would you be willing to answer some questions about what it's like living with that? <br /><br />Anyway	 I know I'll be exposed to you again in some other courses because you won't be happy unless you're causing misery.

"Thanks	 this is a big help in the evaluation	 esp for newbie like me. "
"Sorry	 ALICIA	 you didn't interest me enough to make a point of getting that right. I used your name to clarify whose comment I was referring to	 next time I'll just say ""the chick up there"" and hope you understand I'm talking about you. Ken from MIT??? Really?&nbsp; Well	 he's probably going to be upset with you for that. I'd like to be a fly on the wall. You are so way off base	 but you have been	 right off the bat	 even in your original thread (yeah	 I figure it's you). <br /><br />You read MOST of the thread (as per your own words)	 not all of it and yet you feel qualified to comment like you have all the facts. I hope you don't study for tests the same way because in THIS course I've noticed	 you can't just read SOME of the material and ASSume you know what the course is about. You WILL fail. <br /><br />""Kick your EMAIL27764 IS foul language for an educational forum	 let alone also a threat of violence. I could probably get you kicked out of this course for that	 but I won't. You've got enough problems with your original threads and juggling all your identities on here.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /> "
Try going to the Courses/ Course Dashboard from the drop-down list (where you found Course Records).<br /><br />Can you find the course there? 
"Yes	 Khaos	 I agree. It is rather disappointing	 but you can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped. "
"Yes	 it will be great to see the grading rubric along with the assignment. Is it possible to make this available? "
"Thank you	 Stephanie for your detailed explanation. hope they send certificate through email this time!<br /><br /> "
"Svetlana	 you are complitely right. When I've came here I began to notice that some people are very angry here. It is strange	 cause we all have the same goals and must support each other. I even have thoughts that some people with mental disorders came here to receive help:)) sorry	 it is rude. but from all my courses this course is the most weird because of people around. &nbsp;I even afraid to make some jokes because people will inderstand it seriously. "
Lol yes I noticed felt bad for the Tech that may have made her look incompetent. 
"Phoebe	 I'm so glad you didn't think I was making fun of you with that comment. Cause I like you and want to respect you so I'd never want to make fun of you. Yes I we what you're saying about observation	 but I'd rather call it skill. Too me observing doesn't require much. But with skill you have to apply yourself more. "
"If this works as it does with the other courses	 there will be a link to the certificate on this site.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can download it and print it out.&nbsp;&nbsp; And yes	 you can also save them on your harddisk	 I found no problem doing that with the History of Hollywood one.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> "
"Is gonna mean a lot to me	 I am gonna get it for sure. "
"Your reply made me more confident now. My experiment is pretty simple and it contains only 650 words	 so I'm a little nervous that people would see it as lack of preparation	 lack of effort or below average	 you know	 the upper limit is 1400 words and I did not even reach half of this amount. Now I hope this limit is meant to give students the most flexibility and this would not affect my grade. I've just completed 1 peer assessment in another course but it's fair and I'm very satisfied	 so I think this may not be a bad option in grading. "
"Event though the labels might be used at random	 what matters is the perception of the subjects. The subjects are definitely influenced by the shape	 color	 label	 picture	 etc. of the cups used in an experiment. Therefore the rules of research are very strict that nothing other than the independent variable could be different.<br /> "
Well said!! :-)<br /> 
"Phoebe and Loredana	<br />Those are very thoughtful and considered comments. Thank you. "

"<p>Katherina	 I think it's normal and how the things should be. :) I have plenty of psychological issues myself. Some of them is not a problem anymore	 some I still cannot master. But I truly believe that scientific knowledge greatly contributes to psychological health.

"EMAIL27764 The question asks: ""Did the student say that the data would be analyzed?""&nbsp;&nbsp;That sounds to me like the question is looking for the data to be analyzed.&nbsp; If one is describing the process of analyzing the data	 then it means the same as the data will be analyzed.&nbsp; <br /><br />You seem awfully hateful about the issue	 I do wonder why?&nbsp; "
hey i also got 4/10.. &nbsp;but i attempt the quiz without reading the text. is it ok?.&nbsp; 
"for example on wikipedia:<br /><i>""The beta phenomenon is often confused with the&nbsp;</i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_phenomenon"" target=""""><i>phi phenomenon</i></a><span><i>&nbsp;but they are quite different physiologically. The phi phenomenon can be considered to be an apparent movement caused by luminous impulses in sequence	 (that is to say	 it is lights going on and off at regular intervals)	 whereas the beta movement is an apparent movement caused by lights that do not move	 but seem to.""<br /></i></span>isn't it the same? confused too "
"Ruby	 On the second criteria (<i>The student should explicitly identify and describe the dependent variable	 including an operational definition</i>)	 what score would you give to someone who is not measuring behavior	 but did define and mention a dependent variable? "
"Kathy	 I agree that your understanding is possible. I liked it from the start and use it for grading.<br />But rubric could be more detailed.<br />And again	 I think that 40% of the course mark based on such unreliable and uncontroled assessement is too much.<br /> "
"Nancy	 how come you dont talk to me anymore? I miss my old girl	 I feel a bit down. <br /><br />Hold my hand	 let's cross the rainbow together.<br /><br />xxx "
"Then I guess the safest thing is	 that Alex will notify us all	 once and for all	 EXACTLY about the ""terms"" of this course's quizzes and if indeed we are allowed to consult OUR textbooks or not WHILE taking the ""exams"".&nbsp; "
"There has not been any criterias given. However	 I believe in the thread I listed for you there are some requests by students to the staff for criteria or a rubric to be given before the assignment is due. It&nbsp;might be helpful if you went there and voted those requests up and added your own. "
"EMAIL27764 have had this same thing happen in another class: my answers were being removed after I saved the test.&nbsp; I started checking the answers after my save	 then noticed that the answers were moving after a save and sometimes my clicked answer did not move with it.&nbsp; As an example: if I had clicked the third answer (B)	 then saved	 the answer (B) would move to the top of the list of choices	 but my clicked dot would still be at the third answer rather than move to the top with the answer (B).&nbsp; It was frustrating for me	 but since no one other noticed it	 nothing could be done for it.&nbsp; After that class...I started checking my answers for every question after a save	 not just the location but to make sure the clicked answer is the one I selected.&nbsp; Maybe someone can check into it now that it has happened to others. "
"Awesome news	 thank you Christine! :-)<br /> "
I totally agree with you guys and I hope we can have another session with Professor Smith and team. Having been part of a few other courses on Coursera this one has been very well structured and presented.&nbsp; 
Thanks!! 
"Gosh	 now I feel guilty :-D Don't listen to me	 please!!!<br />You might want to go over some lectures again	 it's not all from OLI.<br /> "
"Phoebe	 thank you for your kind words	 they made me feel better :) You're very (for a lack of a better word) smart! You should be a detective or something :) "
Also concerned about the peer review aspect of this. <br /><br />Hoping that the fact that references are NOT included in the word count will be noted in the grading rubric :) 
"You got a 2? You should request for a remark	 getting a 2 is outrageous if you're making an effort to type an essay.<br /><br />I have graded people who wrote 2 paragraphs without describing about their experiment and I didn't gave them below a 10 too. "
I would give you full marks for your research hypothesis. I feel that you might lose some marks because recording of data wasn't explicitly stated and there doesn't seem to be indication that the results will be analysed.&nbsp; 
"Javier	 please don't start getting down on yourself. I didn't at all intend for the thread to start going in this direction. So could everyone (not focusing on you anonymous) start being civil towards each other? "
How can you have 25 out of 23 points for the first assignment?<br /><br />I think there is a mistake there. 
"I was graded 15. The insteresting is that my ""experiment""&nbsp;was based on the way to report an experiment I found in one of the (very recent) Psychology books I included as resources (cited and consulted). So my evaluators managed to grade the way to report an experiment from the book itself and not just my own one. LOOOOL!&nbsp; "
"I know	 eh! You can comfort yourself with the fact that it couldn't possibly be your post or you. There's something wrong with the person who do it	 not you!<br /> "
totally 
"I think anon was more looking for page numbers or chapters	 not a rewrite of what Alex sent us. ;-) That was so sweet of you!<br /> "
EMAIL27764 think hoping for the best is more than I can do right now.&nbsp; So many people feeling abused right now and there is nothing we can offer by way of help.&nbsp; I do hope that those that feel slighted after the first assignment give it another try and perhaps we have learned to be more reasonable... 
"Kathy	 thank you!<br />But I somewhat squint my eyes on the idea of making profit of people's irrationality. I'm kind of a socialist. :D<br /><br />Javier	 I second Kathy's request. Not a prude	 but I would really love Coursera were free of rude words. Thank you!<br /> "

I'm glad your experience was a good one. Let's see what those who were not so lucky have to say.

"I understand the frustration	 Javier.&nbsp; I took Dan's course and really enjoyed it; however	 I did feel that some people were too ""full of themselves"" to score appropriately.&nbsp; It seems unfair to be forced to just accept a score; there is no&nbsp;place to explain your views with any amount of hope to correct the injustice.&nbsp; "
EMAIL27764 means genetically transferred.&nbsp; I did not mark anything down for referring toward the word genetics instead of heredity. 
"Do you really think the self-righteous individuals that have commented so far give a *bleep* about their peers?? They don't even care about what their professor thinks. They feel they are above all that. I mean	 the professor is only a ... well	 a professor. And they are the holier than thou know it alls. They have no empathy for anyone but themselves!! Notice that everyone of their posts is about what THEY think	 what THEY want to do. <br /><br />Just to clarify for those a little slow in the head:<br /><br /><b>""It is difficult for us to review every submission for plagiarism. If a 
student plagiarizes for the written assignment	 that is his or her loss.
 If you suspect a student has plagiarized his or her assignment	 still

who has plagiarized receives a good grade	 it means that he or she at 
least understands the elements necessary for a valid experiment.""</b>&nbsp; - Alex&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Thu 16 May 2013  1:35 PM EDT (UTC -0400)</i><br /><br />So in other words	 they are aware people are going to plagiarize but feel they are still learning from the course	 obviously since there isn't an original concept left in psychology!! But again	 it doesn't really matter if we agree or not. It's not our decision.&nbsp; <br /><br />BTW No	 John	 it doesn't say ""completely ignore ethical violations"" word for word. However it does say 
 ""If you suspect a student has plagiarized his or her assignment	 <b>still 
evaluate it using the rubric provided</b>.""&nbsp; Close enough!!<br /> "
I didn't use the words 'cultural differences'. I will most likely lose 3 marks for that. Anyone aware if that was part of OLI or lectures? 
"Ferreira	<br />Thank you for your thoughtfulness in letting us know the correction was made. I appreciate it! "
"You didn't read the headline of this thread	 did you? "
Yes! You are right Phoebe. 
"It is a blessing for poor or less competent people	 but I hope you DO realize coursera is available to anyone. I am not poor	 I have a University degree and I  like the opportunity to learn even more. Don't underestimate the public. And why so much hate about the peer reviews specifically? If you are serious about disadvantages	 what about other problems with videos or multiple choice tests? "
"Javier	<br />That is not what the term means!&nbsp;Deepshikha gave the correct answer. "
"This is how I do it: I always calculate the minimum score for the assignment needed to pass the course. Then I evaluate the work of my peers that I'm required to evaluate. Let's say their work is average: I do my best to give them a passing grade	 reading between the lines etc. But	 if the assignments are very poor	 I really can't help it	 it just wouldn't be fair. <br /><br />This time	 the first assignment I got to evaluate was just... nothing. Two or three sentences at the most. Yes	 sentences	 not paragraphs. Others scored between 16 and 22. As others have pointed out	 some of the better works didn't score max points because of the surprising grading rubrics	 and the others had all the elements mentioned even though the experiment itself was not so good. Since I don't like giving the students bad grades	 I usually don't grade a lot of papers (this time the number was 6)	 because nobody guarantees me that I'll get an excellent paper to grade - and I like to grade those	 they always score maximum from me :-)<br /><br />Keeping all of this in mind	 I'm always happy to get a passing grade	 knowing that my grade is the average grade.<br /> "
I agree with your assessment of the requirements of the assignment.&nbsp; We pick either intelligence or schizophrenia and discuss what scientific methods would be appropriate to use to determine the extent of nature or nurture influences on it.&nbsp; I assume we could review our lectures and text for examples of how that question has been addressed in the past and perhaps suggest methods for continuing to answer the&nbsp; problem in the future.&nbsp; In other words the emphasis of our discussion is to be <b>on research methodology </b>not on a specific determination of the cause of intelligence or schizophrenia.&nbsp; <br /> 
I think it's not appropriate for this venue.

Katherina was obviously very frustrated.&nbsp; Perhaps she has calmed down some and felt the post no longer reflected her feelings on the issue.&nbsp; Venting has a way with clearing out bad feelings; let us hope she is feeling better now. 
"We should have a ""suspicion this was plagiarized"" option to flag a submission for the TA. <br /><br />I had one with half a page of references but few of the criterion we have to mark. Odd?<br /> "

I also got 23. May I make a suggestion for assignment 2 do exactly as is asked in the description of the assignment and try to keep the content of your answer simple and unambiguous. That is what I did with assignment 1. I would agree that assignment 2 is more challenging but nil desperandum. Good luck<br />Ann<br /><br />

"Actually	 you are wrong there OP. I am seriously suggesting it because you don't seem very happy in the condition you are in now. No one would see an animal lying on the ground suffering without trying to help. That's how I feel about you. I think you are ""biting"" everyone because you are in pain. If you recall	 I was the first one to OFFER you help. Your thoughts that I'm an evil person intent on bringing you down are part of YOUR hang ups	 part of your paranoia.

"Please don't think an 'anonymous' is... 'anonymous' for... everybody. In some courses from coursera I already finished and am taking right now	 even anonymous (graded) posts or works are graded	 so nobody is 'anonymous'.

Quite right Christine.&nbsp;

Thank you very much Dragana. So... all the topics and units are being covered within the exam?! 
"Lukacs	<br />Don't lose heart. Assuming that you have lost 4 quizzes so far	 yet	 7 more are available. 10 quizzes account for 30% of the grade. You stand a chance of scoring 21% in the remaining 7 quizzes. Final exam carries 30%. So	 even without the 2 Assignments	 your kitty can grow to 51%.<br /><br />And ... now to the Peer Assessments. The word count of <b>1400 is only the upper limit.</b> Alex confirmed that it could be even as small as 300. My design took just 500 words.<br /><br />I suggest that you just look and study the behavioral changes happening around you. You can hit upon an experiment. For example	 people are walking furiously in the morning to reach their work place. Think why some are fast while others are slow. If a foot-wear design gives the comfort and causes speed	 would it mean that bare-footers will be the slowest? On the other hand. in the hot Sun	 bare-footers may rush fast being unable to bear the heat and comfortable shoe wearers may enjoy a slow walk. So	 do shoes really help people walk fast? <b>A valid experiment can bring out the truth.</b><br /><br />Frame a <b>hypothesis</b> that people wearing shoes walk faster than those not wearing any	 resulting in considerable productive man hours.<br /><br />The pair of shoes is the <b>independent variable.</b> One group will wear them. The other group will walk bare foot. While the shoes will give comfort to the first group to briskly and speedily walk	 the scorching sun may drive the second group to reach their destinations fast. Now	 the time taken to reach the destination is the <b>dependent variable.</b><br /><br />You may further <b>manipulate the independent variable</b> by changing it with slippers and the like. The possibility is wide.<br /><br />Record the time taken by all participants and arrive at the <b>conclusion.</b> The conclusion may prove your hypothesis or disprove it. NAME487897ut	 your design becomes a success.<br /><br />Now you know how much energy and time it takes to write a small experiment. And ... most of us are non-english and are barely managing. It need not be a worry. I know	 that once you start the design you will continue and finish it. You can give a pat to yourself.<br /><br />Remember	 this course is not simply 'psychology'	 but&nbsp; <b>'Psychology as a Science'.</b> Research and experiments are integral to it. Let us utilize the opportunity and reap the rewards. You can do it.<br /><br />Start now.<br /> "
"Schizophrenia shows no significant differences across large-scale culture groups like nationality	 race	 religion	 gender; however	 there is significant differences in smaller-scale culture groups like urban-dwellers	 poverty	 and those living in highly restrictive environments like prisons or oppressed socities.&nbsp; "

influence the score of students that are otherwise just below the set

"If I understand correctly	 student states in his/her research hypothesis that nothing will happen when he or she introduces the independent variable(s)?<br /><br />If nothing happens	 then it is a null hypothesis. Someone predicts that nothing will happen. You can't test your hypothesis against the null	 if your hypothesis is the null	 right?<br /><br />I hope that staff members will answer your question.

"... and many others have decided for the most part not to react to anonymous posters for the same reason. That's your choice but that's the risk you take. I think they should get rid of anonymous posters period	 so people can't hide behind a fake cover. If you have an opinion	 have the conviction to stand by it! As for the amount of trolls	 I hate to say it but I think many psychology type courses have a large number of students with mental illnesses. My Astrobiology course had no issues whatsoever.

"Indeed I am	 thx Philip "
"Well	 then I hope you will be one of my peer reviewers	 Hari :)<br /> "
"No way this course is a fiasko!!!<br />Everything about it is great beside the written assignments.

I want to make the entire course successfully finalize hope<br /> 
"NAME2630511eer assessment is an excellent way to learn. I like learning about the writing abilities of other students in my courses	 finding out about what they do better than I and what they do less well than I. NAME2630511eer assessment is also useful because it forces me	 the assessor	 not just to give a grade or say that something is good or bad	 but to justify my grade and give reasons for calling something good or bad. By doing so	 I become much more aware of strengths and shortcomings in my own writing. By contrast	 when an assignment is graded by a professor or by a teaching assistant	 they have very little time for one ... one cog in a large class of students ... and thus rarely ever give any comments on anything.

Ah it's okay. Thanks anyway. :) 
"The book is awesome	 and as the anonymous stated ""with a personal impact of the authors"". Many interesting examples. I think it's a future of the education.  Thanks to the lecturer who chose the book and convinced the publishers to give it to us for free! "

"I completely agree with you Vikash. I have also enrolled months ago for 2 more psy courses and knew that this was the more demanding one. And I like it. The material (OLI) is perfect and it engages you to learn. Simple as that. Only obstacle is time	 'cause you have to get it done i such a short amount of time. This is the ONLY drawback as far I am concerned. Otherwise it's pretty impressive	 though my very first course. So this is a deep dive	 as we say in Greece! "
"Dear Caroline	 thank you very much for your evaluation. :-)<br /><br />Anyway	 I don't think I was wrong in the independent variable	 or in the dependent variables	 since for me these are&nbsp;Â«<i>the behavior that is measured</i><span>Â»	 ie ""percentaged"".

For me too. Statement of accomplishment &nbsp;states 'with distinction' but does not show the percentage. Perrcentage is available on my course records only. 
I agree. From past experience I have also learned to remember my audience when writing. I chose plain English over technical language because many of us do not understand technical language and for many of us English is not our first language (or even our second).

"I'm starting to get the feeling that they are doing everything they can to make it impossible for us to pass this course... like WE'RE some kind of experiment. Think about it. They are constantly giving us unnecessary stressors	 like wrong answers on tests	 and badly planned assignments. They give us directions on what they want to see from us	 and then grade us on something totally different. They put the power of our peers' course results into our hands and then stir things up by posting messages like ""Don't judge plagiarism	 just grade according to the rubric"" and only giving use 2 choices to grade someone	 3 or 0.&nbsp; I'm convinced we are Alex' term paper (which would be totally unethical)	 but if not we are most definitely his 2nd priority to whatever he IS working on. I'm also convinced that he probably talked Dr. Smith into letting him run this course for extra credit. All I know is that apart from the things they CAN'T change	 which are going fabulous (thank you Dr. Smith)	 everything else is a fiasco. I've taken 7 of these course (all scoring between 95-100%)	 this one started as the best of them all. A mild-mannered	 personable and intellectually impressive professor making videos and an amazing tool in the OLI. Now	 I just want this nightmare to end! I'm just waiting for the end to decide what I'm going to do about it. Good luck to you with the rest of the course. I highly doubt anything will be done about this Quiz 10 thing! :-)<br /> "
"I had the same thing happened	 it would not read my red dots. I tried it four times and gave up. I thought it was because of my eyes.

"Danijela	 moj savet vam je da ne odustajete. I da ne dobijete nikakav papir	 dobiÄ‡ete znanje. UÄite koliko moÅ¾ete	 pa kako god da proÄ‘ete	 bar ste dali sve od sebe. Nikada nije kasno odustati :) "
"I&nbsp;saw this too	 but it matches neither the complete assignment	 nor the rubric. Where does it state that you have to give the number of participants? Your quote says to conduct a study; the assignment did not include that. The analzing of data comes after conducting the study (which we were not supposed to do). We were also not required to publish. Therefore	 I submit that this does not provide ""a rubric"" for the assignment - not even close! "
"Well	 it is you who are assessing this work	 the decision and responsibility is on you. :D<br />I think	 however	 that I would ignore the fact that the definition of the term was given and consider only whether the independent variable itself was defined and controlled.<br />And what makes you think that in this particular case the independent variable is not defined?<br /> "
"Don't be so hard on yourself. You did good; better than 11 points!! That's all I can say. Unfortunately	 I can't tell you why because I am thankfully not inside the minds of these people!! But you did good!<br /> "
Thank you very much! That was very helpful! :) <br /> 
"Adding to Kathy's comment: since many people scored more than 3 papers (I did 35)	 you may have had 2	 or 3	 or 5 people who scored yours	 and your grade would be (as Kathy said) the average of all these. "

"Thanks for your comments. 1st assignment needs to be clarified indeed	 is it out of 20 or out of 23? I saw in other threads 35 being used	 not 38	 that's where I possibly got confused.<br /><br />Even so	 my grades are wrong	 but I think in this case I miss the distinction by about 0.5%...<br /><br />Let's see what the staff says about it.

"My calculation was not right. The lowest score on the quizes will drop	 so it is:<br />9.03. <br /> "

I got question 7 in quiz 6 wrong. I rechecked the video lecture and the OLI textbook and still think the answer given in the quiz is wrong. I agree with the above comments. The text and video do not clearly define the type of intelligence given as correct.in the quiz.<br /> 
I found your story about your daughter touching and uplifting.&nbsp; Glad she recovered fully.<br /> 
"Thanks for your comment.<br />Okay	 you say that the week 12 questions in the final exam are only one time accessable (when you have to answer them) while the other questions regarding week 1-11 materials can practized based on old tests many times. Hence	 the week 12 questions are more difficult due to less practize possibilities and should have a higher weight in the final grade score. That is a good point indeed. But in my opinion that should only be regarding the last questions in the final exam (there were	 I believe 2 questions regarding week 12 in the final exam that felt not under the first 10 questions).<br /><br />I agree it would be more balanced to have all quizzes separated and a final exam with a balance regarding the total material.&nbsp; "

"no problem Christine :) thanks<br />I do agree with peer assessment as	 if they find it a great tool for learning	 I accept it - but&nbsp;I have to add that I feel 40% of the final grade is a lot for a peer assessment	 and you just get certified if you have 70% so... even with 100% on quiz and final exam you don't get certified	 your certificate is dependent on your peers	 and if we pay the signature track it gets even more a worry...<br />But I think there are 2 questions here<br />- do or not to do a peer assessment - for me it's ok to do	 if it's a good tool	 so be it<br />- certificate dependent on you peers - for me it's not ok	 even if you're good enough you can be lucky or not<br /><br /> "
The assessment doesn't allow the skipping of questions.&nbsp; There must be another reason.&nbsp; Perhaps the same reason that some people received zeros in the first assignment where they should not have. 
I did finish week 12 but I thought that I needed more than a few hours to concentrated go over everything... don;t you think?

"This is a good point actually. I understand reading the other posts that people want to help other people...that's the way it should be. But psychology is one of the most abused sciences in the world (in my opinion) and to understand that means having to study it somewhat (even on this introductory level). I won't go into the various secret experiments (though exposed through the Freedom of Information Act) of the gov't. But the use of it in deciding how we are educated is really and truly scary. As I said before	 just read the Leipzig Connection and then we can really talk. "
I feel the same way. <br />

"It's A-okay	 Roxana	 nothing to be embarrassed about. Honest mistake! They do offer a signature track but they limit who can join	 so a certificate would give everyone a fair shot. <br /> "
"Thank you	 I re-red this activity few times and despite this	 misunderstood that question :( <br />May be it was to much english for me on that day. "
"I'll jump in and offer that there is no specific instruction that says	 ""Completely ignore ethical violations"". &nbsp;What I mean is that there isn't a directive that specifically asks us to look for plagiarism...but then again	 there isn't a directive that insists that we don't or&nbsp;<b>can't. &nbsp;</b>This is an online course and we're being accessed by our peers. &nbsp;Is the argument that our peers are supposed to turn a blind eye to ethical violations like blatant plagiarism or cheating? &nbsp;Good luck flying that with the instructors. &nbsp;Seriously	 what would one say? &nbsp;""I plagiarized and it isn't fair that someone caught me!"" &nbsp;Really? &nbsp;That's the plan	 the whole plan? &nbsp;If someone decides to hand out a zero for a completely plagiarized work AND they can defend their position in the comments section...hmmm	 I dunno.<br /><br />""Just know that you have also been reported and if they see you giving out zeroes it will be considered a violation of Couseras Honor Code and you will be dealt with."" &nbsp;What? &nbsp;Is that some sort of joke? &nbsp;It's a violation of the honor code to report plagiarism? &nbsp;Really? &nbsp;Where in the honor code does it say that? &nbsp;I just looked for myself and I don't see any reference to not pointing out plagiarism.<br /> "
"<p>No way.<br />All those who post your experiments	 you are brave persons.  </p>

what type&nbsp; of Master...of the univers? 
Thanks for the heads up. I guess i can't complain then.&nbsp; 
This course has had me totally absorbed!!!! Love it!! :D 
I have heard from others that the Coursera program actually allows the max word count plus 10%. Can anyone else verify this? 
And cultural differences.<br /> 
"Yeah	 but isn't it very strange that the environmental factors weren't evaluated?? I mean isn't this the debate all about. Ok with the nature	 we've covered that	 but what about the environment? And ok	 in Intelligence someone can argue about cultural differences	 whereas black people feel for example more comfortable when asked or perform sports	 but in schizophrenia?? "
"Yes	 it does help. Thank you so much for your quick and thorough response!&nbsp; "
"In another course that I took	 peer assessment training was given to students who agreed to grade an assignment and have his/her assignment graded by another student. I am wondering if we will have a similar training in this course. Another question is whether we can request a re-assessment	 in case the grade of an assignment is completely different than what we were expecting.<br /> "
"For the Aspects you've picked some major psychologist's thesis? I wasn't sure about the ""aspect"" and what it meant "
"Yes 	 me too	 I'd like a little more challenge ..&nbsp; <br /><br /> "
"I think it's a difficult topic to evaluate	 I agree with you that ""intelligence"" can be seen as a ""hypothetical construct"" but then again I would still have some problems with viewing an intelligence test as a kind of behavior.<br />And does television actually influence your level of intelligence?<br /> "
"Well Nancy	 an idea about the grading for assignment No2	 is for all of us to give out a perfect score! Why the hell not? Or someone feels like playing the professor? Well	 you're not and many of us have seen what good this has done to us! "
"Thanks	 Alex	 that is good news. I can have time to practice with OLI and to prepare for January and then test my hopefully better knowledge of psychology. "
"My suggestion.<br />If you are sure that the design is not original and that it is copied	 give zero marks for all criterion. After results are published	 the particular student will cry foul and seek an explanation from the assessor (you). You can quote the following instruction mentioned in the syllabus page.<br /><br />""Plagiarism is considered a serious offense. Please make sure that all 
materials that you submit in any assignments	 projects	 or quizzes are 
your own. If you copy and paste or copy word for word from the Internet 
or any other source	 that is considered plagiarism. You will be 
immediately removed from the class if you plagiarize.""<br /><br />If you are hesitant	 let the lucky fellow enjoy his grade :-)<br /> "
Hi! Nice to meet you! I'm still starting on my first couple of books on Jung and Freud (really slow reader here) and I'll give Hayao Kawai books a shot if I spot it in the local library. Thanks for the recommendation.&nbsp;

I can't find it. Where is it? 
"Peer assessments were having a maximun score of 23 for the first &amp; 15 for the second opne	 a total of 38. You have to convert your score out of 38 to the score out of 40. (If your score is X / 38	 it can be converted as X / 38 muliplied by 40) "
"I like to think that in that fashion	 Anony.&nbsp; Before one accuses	 they should consider: what if I am wrong?&nbsp; What if the software you are using to pin-down cheaters is less than perfect?&nbsp; I suggest that if you strongly believe the paper is completely copied	&nbsp;assess&nbsp;and grade as instructed	 then click the little flag button in the lower right corner and report as a&nbsp;wrong against the Honor Code.&nbsp; Let the authorities sort it out.

"First of all	 I admit I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder	 BIpolar Disorder Type 2	 and PTSD. Second	 I DISAGREE with the OP that this peer assessment violates the Americans With Disabilities Act. In fact	 I resent people ABUSING the ADA for petty grievances like the OP is doing here. The ADA was meant for serious violations of disabled people's rights. If the ADA is abused	 nobody will take it seriously! I got a low grade	 a 5	 by the way. I did put many hours into my written Assignment $2. However	 I am going to learn from the experience. Yes	 I felt let down	 but I am NOT going to whine over and over about it. I took this course to learn and understand about Psychology	 and I am satisfied with this course.

You are right.<br /> 
"Svetlana	 you are right	 it is how negative or positive factors of culture are involved affect the question. But Annette's assessment (and her downgrade of my comment) make me wonder how we can expect students to fairly evaluate when they disagree? I'll expect more minus marks ;-)<br /> "
"Okay	 I will. ;D All of this would have been for naught if I can't get into a good university because of my results	 after all.&nbsp;<br /><br />Well	 happy studying!

"Actually	 the announcement stated<i> ""</i><span><i>Since <b>there is no quiz for Week 12</b>	 the first 10 of these questions will cover Week 12."" &nbsp;</i>In other words	 the final exam merely contained more questions on week 12 than it would have done had there been a quiz in week 12. &nbsp;Nowhere does it say that the first 10 questions are a separate quiz. &nbsp;I've bolded the bit that you may have missed.</span> "
"Word of Honor	 eh?? This is the same guy that told us	 and I quote&nbsp; <br /><br />""For those of you who are interested in doing well on the second written 
assignment	 I appreciate your engagement in the course. To help with the
 assignment	 let's break up the prompt into different sections. These 
can be different sections within your assignment.<br />
<br />
""Discuss the 'nature versus nurture' question.""<br />
You should describe what the fundamental question is here. To what 
aspects of psychology does it apply? What have various psychologists 
said in response to it? What conclusions	 if any	 have been reached 
regarding this question?<br />
<br />
""Indicate how we collect data to address this issue.""<br />
What methods (studies	 research	 etc.) have been employed to attempt to answer the ""nature versus nurture"" question?<br />
<br />
""Pick one of the two constructs listed. Is the construct being studied 
determined by genetics or by the environment through experience?""<br />
State as precisely as possible the extent to which your chosen construct
 is determined by nature or by nurture. The important part here is <b>how you make your case</b>
 for whether your construct is determined more by nature or by nurture. 
It's an excellent idea to refer back to the methods from the previous 
section and discuss how each method could be (or already has been) 
applied to answer the ""nature versus nurture"" question <i>for this specific construct</i>.""<br /><br />And then he proceeded to give us a grading rubric that had NOTHING to do with the above	 and only recognized ""heritability"" either ""yes"" = 3 or ""no"" = 0	 thereby ensuring that several people will be failing this class after working hard for 12 weeks. <br /><br />There is no HONOR in that!!<br /> "
"In the following link I have expressed many of that kind of concerns. <br /><a title=""Link: https://class.coursera.org/psy-001/forum/thread?thread_id=1235"" href=""https://class.coursera.org/psy-001/forum/thread?thread_id=1235"">https://class.coursera.org/psy-001/forum/thread?thread_id=1235</a><br />I provide the link as not to repeat myself.<br />Feel free to comment.<br /> "
Really??? 
"I see your point	 however	 if the purpose is for you to know which elements should be there	 the questions should be to describe the elements included in an experiment.&nbsp;<br />I would totally agree if we had been provided examples or links to examples	 or if this would be a formative assessment (trying to help you learning	 but not evaluating you on the results).<br />I am not at all doubting the value of finding out by yourself how to compose an experiment	 based on theory. I just believe it is more efficient to tell people how they should do it	 and according to instructional design methods (again	 I refer to Bob Mager)	 you should let people know what is expected of them.<br /><br />I assume that	 considering the large number of participants to these courses	 it is hard to accomodate all levels of preparation. <br /><br />And I am not complaining for the points I will get. I am sincerely interested in making the learning experience better for everyone (maybe that could be an experiment to be proposed: half of the students would have clear instructions and half would not	 and one could check on the ability to write not this but the next experiment	 who has learned better (which I believe is the overall objective of this exercise	 not just the score	 right?)<br /> "
"Christine	 I love that idea! &nbsp;I think I might start organizing my notes in that way too! &nbsp;Thanks for the tip! "
Thank you thank you thank you 
Thank you Alex :)<br /> 
"Well	 I'm taking this introductory course which implies I don't know much about the inner workings of the mind but from what I've read and some documentaries I've seen	 you quoting Freud doesn't really mean that much nowadays since most of his theories have been ""debunked"" by modern studies. Sure	 he is regarded as the father of psychoanalysis but because he was the first to have studied that facet of psychology. "
"Without seeing the actual submission you are being asked to evaluate	 it is very difficult to comment on whether this was a good experiment. If the experiment was measuring IQ scores attained by participants tested under differing testing conditions	 for example	 this might be a very valid experiment.<br /> "
"Me too	 Annette.&nbsp; I could not see down-grading because they chose a different word.&nbsp; There are so many words in the English language alone	 why would everyone be expected to use the same word when there are so many other cultures involved in this course?&nbsp; "
"Hey	 you can't expect me to have ALL the answers  ;-) "
"Iryna	<br />The question is 'what is the percentage above the threshold?'<br />The answer is 97.50%<br />You might have clicked the area below the threshold and arrived at the wrong answer.<br /> "

"I agree	 Sarah	 the assignment was intended as a learning tool; however	 for many of the students	 the only thing learned was not to trust other students with grades.&nbsp; I wish that there was a way to address the issues that some people have had	 but I have not found a way yet.&nbsp; <br /><br />Unfortunately	 assignment two is just as vague.&nbsp; I have no idea how it will be graded and the threads are already asking for clarity.&nbsp; I&nbsp;wonder if it will even be worth bothering with since what happened with the first assignment could easily happen again.&nbsp; "
"Thank you	 Nancy! :)<br /><br />PS<br />I remember you! :)<br />We have participate at the same thread - on the grading - &nbsp;for the course IHTS! :)<br />Nice to meet you! :) "
"Thank you very much	 Christine	 for your nice words. :-)&nbsp; I was lucky that my peers graded my work kindly. But I was also lucky that I was in a good frame of mind for the course. If I had been in a more depressive state	 I would have had to leave the course. This is what living with an illness is all about; it's not an uncommon experience. In my case	 when my anxieties appeared	 I tried to hang around in the forums a bit to see if others were going through the same stressors as I. There were MANY!!! Just reading their comments helped me out. I noticed that people were so willing to help! That's what got me through the tough times. Christine	 you just prove my point!! Rely on your peers and you can't go wrong! :-)<br /> "
"BTW your comment above I have to begrudgingly say I kind of agree with you. If you had been less arrogant and condescending	 I might even have given you an upvote. But then you have to go and be yourself	 in all your offensive glory. You're smart. Too bad no one will ever know because they don't want to get to know you! Oh well!<br /> "
"Nancy	<br /><br />I agree with you that if you have paid even 1 dollar then you have some demands. I only said about my point of view. But it is clear that 40% of our grade comes from peer evaluation. Even if the criteria of evaluation were clarified you might face the possibility of an unfair grade. <br />Although i always enjoy a good conversation	 I believe that i am already off topic and i would like to end the conversation at this point. Each of us have his or her own opinion about the course and every opinion is respected. <br /> "
"Wow....look the Little princes showing her true colors. I love when I&nbsp;produce &nbsp;this effect&nbsp;in a lady	lol.<br /><br />Okay	 first of all...when I said you didnÂ´t pay anything	 I was using a figure of speech. The 50 or 60 dollars that you paid get you a couple of macmenus and two cinema tickets....if you compare this with the 50 thousand bucks people pay in the USA	 it is fair to say that you paid NOTHING.<br /><br /><br />Second	 why so focused on my profile	 or my opinions about anal sex? Are you angry because you donÂ´t live in Barcelona? Sorry baby...but I was very clear	 only Barcelona ladies	 face-to-face jobs.<br /><br />Third	 all those courses you mention are okay	 but I would not change Introduction to Psychology for any of them	 and you know why? Because people choose. You chose to start this course	 you now can choose to leave it.<br /><br />Fourth: Alex is doing a great job	 probably biting his tongue at all the whiners like you	 who think the world revolves around them.<br /><br />And five: no matter how many signature tracks you pay for....with that attitude you wont ever make anything in life. "
"Can this be clarified because it doesn't say anything about a True experiment	 it refers to a GOOD experiment	 surely a quasi- experiment can be a good one.<br /> "
But we have a whole week to complete it. so... ? 
"Christine<br />Thank you for your comments. However	 whatever the methodology or the content of the assessments	 it is the <b>peer assessment </b>component that I am uncomfortable with - especially when it represents <b>40%</b> of the final grade (that information having already been provided). This is not an appropriate or equitable approach - especially for anyone on Signature Track. While it may be true that your students tended to be generous in marking their peers	 this is not always the case - as I said before	 the inconsistency in marking (to both extremes) in my previous Coursera peer-assessment experiences was quite dreadful.<br /><br /> "
"All my other Coursera classes not only allow	 but encourage us to save the quiz if we are having trouble with it and review before returining to it. The ""Honor Code"" button that you have to click to submit is an agreement that the work you are submitting is yours alone	 so as long as you didn't get the answers from someone else	 you are okay. "
"Good job	 Kathy. "
"I'd like to give each student as many points as possible	 but stay fair. "
"Phoebe	 you bring up such a good point. I guess I can't know how hard the material will be till I've actually seen it. &nbsp;It's just that by the names of some of the classes they sounded hard. "
My apologies for the wrong information. I dont have the assignment on mine.&nbsp; Anonymous could you be so kind to tell me where to look since it is not in my peer assessments and its not anywhere that I am looking. Syllabus and announcements included.&nbsp; I would really appreciate it very much......Thanks!<br />

"Velma We are all getting that. A few weeks ago they had some practice exercises up	 they have since been taken down.&nbsp; When its time to do the Peer Review an E-mail should be sent to all of us	 but just in case just keep watching the forums	 I am betting as soon as the assignments go out there are going to be a whole lot of people posting in the forums. <br /> "
"Beverly	<br />Give me all eleven quiz scores	 two peer assessment scores and the final exam scores. I will calculate for you. Reason: as per course staff some of us have weird scores and they are trying to figure it out. I hope you did pass	 lets calculate. See this announcement:<br /><h3>Grading questions</h3><div>I see that many of you have received the incorrect grades for the course. Please know that I am working with Coursera to figure out what the problem is. Once I do that	 I will reissue the grades and certificates.<br /><br />Thanks for letting me know about this problem	 and I appreciate your patience.<br /><br />- Alex</div><div>Thu 27 Jun 2013 3:45 PM IST (UTC +0530)</div> "
"You were supposed to design an experiment comparing how you woud test one group (the control) against another that would have an independant variable introduced	 and predict what you think would happen under the circumstances&nbsp;of the specific&nbsp;experiment that you were designing. <br /><br />What are you testing?<br />What are you expecting to prove&nbsp;with your experiment?<br />How many people are you testing	 and what is the process that you will use to test them?<br />What&nbsp;is the independant variable that you are choosing?<br />What types of data are you collecting and how will you compare the data?<br />How will you avoid confounding your experiment	 what precautions are you taking?<br /><br />I do not see answers to these questions in your experiment.<br /><br /><br /> "
thanks Hari 
"My records of your comments were kept for the protection of everyone in here	 even yourself. Since you seriously seem delusional	 I felt it would be good to have	 to show Coursera what you have been up to. You know	 just in case... because I had a feeling you would try to cover your tracks by deleting your comments. So predictable.&nbsp; ;-) <br /> "
"EMAIL25707 My assignment is complete and I	 like most other students	 also worked to get a good score.&nbsp;You've missed my point.&nbsp;<br />==&gt; In the online textbook	 page 17	 the most basic information about methods is described as a 5-step process	 this includes&nbsp;diagramed.&nbsp; More detailed information about experimental methods can be found on page 23 and 24.&nbsp; &lt;== "
"Fernanda	 The idea of a pre-test is to take it now to find out how much you know at this point. Then you take it again at the end of the course to find out how much your knowledge has increased. The second one may actually be a little different so that no one can memorize the answers from the first and expect to pass the second. Your score on these is not part of your final grade; it's just a measurement of whether this course was effective in teaching you about psychology. "
That's not the reason why I deleted my posts ;).  All I can say is... google my name :) 
You have done it. The only way appears to be to check the box for anonymity before adding a post.<br /> 
"""A person who is physically fit will usually emphasize the lower loop and it will be darker (because of the varying pressure we use while writing) in the handwriting	 a person who is not physically fit will usually write this lower area in a very light shade""&nbsp; --&nbsp; Data from this will be studied to see if the diabetic group has a significantly higher number of people who write with dark lower loops as compared to the control group"" <br /><br />I am a little confused by these too sentences: you want to tell if a person has diabetes	 but you expect the diabetic group to have the dark lower loops as the physically fit people will.&nbsp; If I have this correct	 how will that determine if someone has blood-sugar issues?
